---

The RTVI (Real-Time Voice and Video Inference) standard defines a set of message types and structures sent between clients and servers. It is designed to facilitate real-time interactions between clients and AI applications that require voice, video, and text communication. It provides a consistent framework for building applications that can communicate with AI models and the backends running those models in real-time.

<Note>
  This page documents version 1.0 of the RTVI standard, released in June 2025.

## Terms

- **Client**: The front-end application or user interface that interacts with the RTVI server.
- **Server**: The backend-end service that runs the AI framework and processes requests from the client.
- **User**: The end user interacting with the client application.
- **Bot**: The AI interacting with the user, technically an amalgamation of a large language model (LLM) and a text-to-speech (TTS) service.

## RTVI Message Format

The messages defined as part of the RTVI protocol adhere to the following format:

```json
{
    "id": string,
    "label": "rtvi-ai",
    "type": string,
    "data": unknown
}
```

<ParamField path="id" type="string" required={false}>
  A unique identifier for the message, used to correlate requests and responses.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="label" type="string" required={true} default="rtvi-ai">
  A label that identifies this message as an RTVI message. This field is
  required and should always be set to `'rtvi-ai'`.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="type" type="string" required={true}>
  The type of message being sent. This field is required and should be set to
  one of the predefined RTVI message types listed below.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="data" type="unknown" required={false}>
  The payload of the message, which can be any data structure relevant to the
  message type.
</ParamField>

## RTVI Message Types

Following the above format, this section describes the various message types defined by the RTVI standard. Each message type has a specific purpose and structure, allowing for clear communication between clients and servers.

<Tip>
  Each message type below includes either a 🤖 or 🏄 emoji to denote whether the
  message is sent from the bot (🤖) or client (🏄).
</Tip>

### Connection Management

#### client-ready 🏄

Indicates that the client is ready to receive messages and interact with the server. Typically sent after the transport media channels have connected.

- **type**: `'client-ready'`
- **data**:
  - **version**: `string`

    The version of the RTVI standard being used. This is useful for ensuring compatibility between client and server implementations.

  - **about**: `AboutClient Object`

    An object containing information about the client, such as its rtvi-version, client library, and any other relevant metadata. The `AboutClient` object follows this structure:

    <Expandable title="AboutClient">
      <ParamField path="library" type="string" required />
      <ParamField path="library_version" type="string" />
      <ParamField path="platform" type="string" />
      <ParamField path="platform_version" type="string" />
      <ParamField path="platform_details" type="any">
        Any platform-specific details that may be relevant to the server. This
        could include information about the browser, operating system, or any
        other environment-specific data needed by the server. This field is
        optional and open-ended, so please be mindful of the data you include
        here and any security concerns that may arise from exposing sensitive or
        personal-identifiable information.
      </ParamField>
    </Expandable>

#### bot-ready 🤖

Indicates that the bot is ready to receive messages and interact with the client. Typically send after the transport media channels have connected.

- **type**: `'bot-ready'`
- **data**:
  - **version**: `string`

    The version of the RTVI standard being used. This is useful for ensuring compatibility between client and server implementations.

  - **about**: `any` (Optional)

    An object containing information about the server or bot. It's structure and value are both undefined by default. This provides flexibility to include any relevant metadata your client may need to know about the server at connection time, without any built-in security concerns. Please be mindful of the data you include here and any security concerns that may arise from exposing sensitive information.

#### disconnect-bot 🏄

Indicates that the client wishes to disconnect from the bot. Typically used when the client is shutting down or no longer needs to interact with the bot. Note: Disconnets should happen automatically when either the client or bot disconnects from the transport, so this message is intended for the case where a client may want to remain connected to the transport but no longer wishes to interact with the bot.

- **type**: `'disconnect-bot'`
- **data**: `undefined`

#### error 🤖

Indicates an error occurred during bot initialization or runtime.

- **type**: `'error'`
- **data**:
  - **message**: `string`

    Description of the error.

  - **fatal**: `boolean`

    Indicates if the error is fatal to the session.

### Speaking and Transcription

#### user-started-speaking 🤖

Emitted when the user begins speaking

  Introduced in RTVI version 1.2.0 (Pipecat 0.0.102, client-js 1.6.0).
</Note>

Emitted when the server begins ignoring audio from the client (server-side muting). The client should continue sending audio normally but may want to show an indication to the user that their input is not being processed.

- **type**: `'user-mute-started'`
- **data**: None

#### user-mute-stopped 🤖

<Note>
  Introduced in RTVI version 1.2.0 (Pipecat 0.0.102, client-js 1.6.0).
</Note>

Emitted when the server stops ignoring audio from the client (server-side muting ends). The client can update its UI to indicate that the user's input is being processed again.

- **type**: `'user-mute-stopped'`
- **data**: None

#### user-transcription 🤖

Real-time transcription of user speech, including both partial and final results.

- **type**: `'user-transcription'`

    The timestamp when the transcription was generated.

  - **user_id**: `string`

    Identifier for the user who spoke.

#### bot-output 🤖

The best-effort representation of the bot's output text, including both spoken and unspoken text. In addition to transcriptions of spoken text, this message type may also include text that the bot outputs but does not speak (e.g., text sent to the client for display purposes only). Along with the text, this event includes a `spoken` flag to indicate whether the text was spoken by the bot or not and an `aggregated_by` field to indicate what the text represents (e.g. "sentence", "word", "code", "url").

- **type**: `'bot-output'`
- **data**:
  - **text**: `string`

    The output text from the bot.

  - **spoken**: `boolean`

    Indicates if this text was spoken by the bot.

  - **aggregated_by**: `string`

    Indicates how the text was aggregated (e.g., "sentence", "word", "code", "url"). "sentence" and "word" are reserved aggregation types defined by the RTVI standard. Other aggregation types may be defined by custom text aggregators used by the server.

#### bot-transcription 🤖

<Warning>
  DEPRECATED in favor of `bot-output` in Pipecat version 0.0.95 and client-js
  version 1.5.0
</Warning>

Transcription of the bot's speech. Note: This protocol currently does not match the user transcription format to support real-time timestamping for bot transcriptions. Rather, the event is typically sent for each sentence of the bot's response. This difference is currently due to limitations in TTS services which mostly do not support (or support well), accurate timing information. If/when this changes, this protocol may be updated to include the necessary timing information. For now, if you want to attempt real-time transcription to match your bot's speaking, you can try using the `bot-tts-text` message type.

- **type**: `'bot-transcription'`
- **data**:
  - **text**: `string`

    The transcribed text from the bot, typically aggregated at a per-sentence level.

### Client-Server Messaging

- **type**: `'server-message'`
- **data**: `any`

  The `data` can be any JSON-serializable object, formatted according to your own specifications.

#### client-message 🏄

An arbitrary message sent from the client to the server. This can be used for custom interactions or commands. This message may be coupled with the `server-response` message type to handle responses from the server.
