## RTVIError Type

Base `RTVIClient` error type, extends [`Error`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error) and primarily introducing the `status` field. Most methods will try to throw an error of this type when something goes wrong.

<ParamField path="status" type="number" required="false">
A unique identifier (or HTTP code if applicable) for the error.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="message" type="string" required="false">
A human-readable message describing the error.
</ParamField>

## Pre-defined RTVIErrors

### ConnectionTimeoutError

Emitted when the bot does not enter a ready state within the specified timeout period during the `connect()` method call.

### StartBotError

Emitted when the `connect()` method is called with an endpoint, and the endpoint responds with an error or the `fetch` itself fails. This may be due to the endpoint being unavailable, or the server failing to parse the provided data.

<ParamField path="error" type="string" required="true">
All `StartBotError` instances will have an `error` field set to `invalid-request-error`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="status" type="number" required="false">
HTTP status code returned by the endpoint, if applicable.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="message" type="string" required="false">
Verbose error message returned by the endpoint, if provided. To take advantage of this, the endpoint should return an error response with a JSON object with an `info` field containing the error message.
</ParamField>

### TransportStartError

Emitted when the Transport is not able to connect. You may need to check the connection parameters provided or returned from you endpoint.

### BotNotReadyError

Emitted when the client attempts to perform an action or method that requires the bot to be in a ready state, but the bot is not ready. You must call `connect()` first and wait for the bot to be ready before performing such actions.

### UnsupportedFeatureError

Not all Transports are created equal, and some may not support certain features. This error is thrown when a feature is requested that the current Transport does not support.

<ParamField path="feature" type="string" required="true">
This custom field will contain the name of the unsupported feature.
</ParamField>
