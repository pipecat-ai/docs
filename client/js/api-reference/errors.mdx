## RTVIError Type

Base `PipecatClient` error type, extends [`Error`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error) and primarily introduces the `status` field. Most methods will try to throw an error of this type when something goes wrong. This is different from the RTVI error event and its corresponding [`onError` callback](./callbacks#param-on-error), which are used for communicating errors that are sent by the bot.

<ParamField path="status" type="number">
A unique identifier (or HTTP code if applicable) for the error.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="message" type="string">
A human-readable message describing the error.
</ParamField>

## Pre-defined RTVIErrors

### ConnectionTimeoutError

Emitted when the bot does not enter a ready state within the specified timeout period during the `connect()` method call.

### StartBotError

Emitted from `startBot()` or `startBotAndConnect()` when the endpoint responds with an error or the `fetch` itself fails. This may be due to the endpoint being unavailable, or the server failing to parse the provided data.

<ParamField path="error" type="string" required>
All `StartBotError` instances will have an `error` field set to `invalid-request-error`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="status" type="number">
HTTP status code returned by the endpoint, if applicable.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="message" type="string">
Verbose error message returned by the endpoint, if provided. To take advantage of this, the endpoint should return an error response with a JSON object with an `info` field containing the error message.
</ParamField>

### TransportStartError

Emitted when the Transport is not able to connect. You may need to check the connection parameters provided or returned from you endpoint.

### BotNotReadyError

Emitted when the client attempts to perform an action or method that requires the bot to be in a ready state, but the bot is not ready. You must call `connect()` first and wait for the bot to be ready before performing such actions.

### DeviceError

Emitted when there is an issue with acquiring or using a media device, such as a camera or microphone. This could be due to permissions issues, device unavailability, or other related problems.

<ParamField path="devices" type="array<'cam' | 'mic' | 'speaker'>" required>
List of media devices, `'cam'`, `'mic'`, and/or `'speaker'`, that are unavailable or could not be accessed.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="type" type="string" required>
The `type` field will indicate what type of device error occurred. Options include:
  - `"in-use"`: A device is currently in use by another application and cannot be accessed. *windows only*
  - `"permissions"`: The user has not granted permission to access the media device.
  - `"undefined-mediadevices"`: `getUserMedia()` is not an available API on the current platform or browser.
  - `"not-found"`: The specified media device could not be found.
  - `"constraints"`: The media device could not be configured with the specified constraints.
  - `"unknown"`: An unknown error occurred while accessing the media device.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="details" type="object">
Additional details about the device error, if available.
</ParamField>

### UnsupportedFeatureError

Not all Transports are created equal, and some may not support certain features. This error is thrown when a feature is requested that the current Transport does not support.

<ParamField path="feature" type="string" required>
This custom field will contain the name of the unsupported feature.
</ParamField>
