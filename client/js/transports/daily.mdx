title: "Daily WebRTC Transport"
---

The DailyTransport class provides a WebRTC transport layer using [Daily.co's](https://daily.co) infrastructure. It wraps a Daily-JS call client to handle audio/video device management, WebRTC connections, and real-time communication between clients and bots. For complete documentation on Daily's API, see the [Daily API Reference](https://docs.daily.co/reference/daily-js).

This transport is designed for production use cases, leveraging Daily's global infrastructure for low-latency, high-quality audio and video streaming. It expects your Pipecat server to include the corresponding [`DailyTransport` server-side](/server/services/transport/daily) implementation.

## Usage

### Basic Setup

```javascript
import { PipecatClient } from "@pipecat-ai/client-js";
import { DailyTransport } from "@pipecat-ai/daily-transport";

const pcClient = new PipecatClient({
  transport: new DailyTransport({
    // DailyTransport constructor options
    bufferLocalAudioUntilBotReady: true, // Optional, defaults to false
    inputSettings: { video: { processor: { type: "background-blur" } } },
  }),
  enableCam: false, // Default camera off
  enableMic: true, // Default microphone on
  callbacks: {
    // Event handlers
  },
  // ...
});

await pcClient.connect({
  url: "https://your-domain.daily.co/room",
  token: "your-daily-token", // Optional, if your room requires authentication
});
```

## API Reference

### Constructor Options

```typescript
interface DailyTransportConstructorOptions extends DailyFactoryOptions {
  bufferLocalAudioUntilBotReady?: boolean;
}
```

<ParamField path="bufferLocalAudioUntilBotReady" type="boolean" default="false" required="false">

If set to `true`, the transport will buffer local audio until the bot is ready. This is useful for ensuring that bot gets any audio from the user that started before the bot is ready to process it.

</ParamField>

<ParamField path="DailyFactoryOptions">

The `DailyTransportConstructorOptions` extends the `DailyFactoryOptions` type that is accepted by the underlying Daily instance. These options are passed directly through to the Daily constructor. See the [Daily API Reference](https://docs.daily.co/reference/daily-js/daily-call-client/properties) for a complete list of options.

<Note>
  While you can provide the room url and optional token as part of your
  constructor options, the typical pattern is to provide them via a connection
  endpoint with `startBot()` or directly as part of `connect()`. See below.
</Note>

</ParamField>

### TransportConnectionParams

On `connect()`, the `DailyTransport` optionally takes a set of [`DailyCallOptions`](https://docs.daily.co/reference/daily-js/daily-call-client/methods#dailycalloptions) to connect to a Daily room. This can be provided directly to the `PipecatClient`'s `connect()` method or via a starting endpoint passed to the `PipecatClient`'s `startBotAndConnect()` method. If using an endpoint, your endpoint should return a JSON object matching the `DailyCallOptions` type. See the [client connect()](https://docs.pipecat.ai/client/js/api-reference/client-methods#connect) documentation for more information.

<CodeGroup>
```typescript client
pcClient.connect({
  url: 'https://your.daily.co/room'
});
// OR...
pcClient.startBotAndConnect({
  endpoint: '/api/start', // Your server endpoint to start the bot
});
```

```python server
@app.post("/api/start")
async def start(request: Request) -> Dict[Any, Any]:
    print("Creating room and token for RTVI connection")
    room_url, token = await create_room_and_token()

    # Start the bot process
    print("Starting bot subprocess")
    try:
        subprocess.Popen(
            [f"python3 -m bot.py -u {room_url} -t {token}"],
            shell=True,
            bufsize=1,
            cwd=os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)),
        )
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=f"Failed to start subprocess: {e}")

    # Return the Daily call options in format expected by DailyTransport/Daily Call Object
    return {"url": room_url, "token": token}
```

</CodeGroup>

### Methods

For most operations, you will not interact with the transport directly. Most methods have an equivalent in the `PipecatClient` and should be called from the `PipecatClient`. However, there are a few transport-specific methods that you may need to call directly. When doing so, be sure to access your transport via the `transport` property of the `PipecatClient` instance.

- `preAuth()`

  This is the one method meant to be called directly, which is used to allow you to gather information about the Daily room prior to connecting. As a Daily-specific action, it is not exposed through the `PipecatClient`. This method must be called prior to `connect()` and use the same `room_url` and `token` (optional) as what will be used on `connect()`.

  ```typescript
  pcClient.transport.preAuth({
    url: "https://your.daily.co/room",
    token: "your_token",
  });
  const roomInfo = pcClient.transport.dailyCallClient.room();
  ```

## Events

The transport implements the various [`PipecatClient` event handlers](https://docs.pipecat.ai/client/js/api-reference/callbacks). For Daily-specific events, you can attach listeners to the underlying Daily call client. For a list of available events, see the [Daily API Reference](https://docs.daily.co/reference/daily-js/events).

```typescript
pcClient.transport.dailyCallClient.on('recording-started', (ev) => {...});
```

## Advanced

### Accessing the Daily Call

For advanced use cases, where you may need to work with the Daily call client directly, you can access it via the `dailyCallClient` property.

```javascript
const dailyCall = pcClient.transport.dailyCallClient;
```

<Note>
  The Daily call client returned is safe-guarded to not allow you to call
  functions which affect the call's lifecycle and will redirect you to use
  either a Transport method or the `PipecatClient` to perform the equivalent
  action.
</Note>
