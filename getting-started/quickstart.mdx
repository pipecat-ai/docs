---

This quickstart guide will help you build and deploy your first Pipecat voice AI bot. You'll create a simple conversational agent that you can talk to in real-time, then deploy it to production on Pipecat Cloud.

**Two steps**: Local Development (5 min) → Production Deployment (5 min)

## Step 1: Local Development

### Prerequisites

**Environment**

- Python 3.10 or later
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) package manager installed

**AI Service API Keys**

This quickstart uses three AI services working together in a pipeline. You'll need API keys from each service:

    synthesis.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Have these API keys ready. You'll add them to your environment file in the next section.

### Setup

1. Clone the quickstart repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat-quickstart.git
cd pipecat-quickstart
```

2. Configure your API keys

Create your environment file:

```bash
cp env.example .env
```

Open the `.env` file in your text editor and add your API keys:

```ini
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_deepgram_api_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
CARTESIA_API_KEY=your_cartesia_api_key
```

3. Set up virtual environment and install dependencies

```bash
uv sync
```

### Run your bot locally

Now you're ready to run your bot! Start it with

```bash
uv run bot.py
```

You should see output similar to this:

```
🚀 WebRTC server starting at http://localhost:7860/client
   Open this URL in your browser to connect!
```

Open http://localhost:7860/client in your browser and click **Connect** to start talking to your bot.

<Note>
  **First run note**: The initial startup may take ~20 seconds as Pipecat
  downloads required models and imports. Subsequent runs will be much faster.
</Note>

🎉 **Success!** Your bot is running locally. Now let's deploy it to production so others can use it.

## Step 2: Deploy to Production

Transform your local bot into a production-ready service. Pipecat Cloud handles scaling, monitoring, and global deployment.

### Prerequisites

1. Sign up for Pipecat Cloud

[Create your Pipecat Cloud account](https://pipecat.daily.co/sign-up) to deploy and manage your bots.

2. Set up Docker

- **Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)** on your system
- **Create a [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) account**
- **Login to Docker Hub:**

```bash
docker login
```

3. Pipecat CLI

The Pipecat CLI is already installed with your quickstart project.

Log in to Pipecat Cloud using the CLI to get started:

```bash
uv run pipecat cloud auth login
```

You'll be presented with a link that you can click to authenticate your client.

### Configure your deployment

The `pcc-deploy.toml` file tells Pipecat Cloud how to run your bot. **Update the image field** with your Docker Hub username:

```toml
agent_name = "quickstart"
image = "YOUR_DOCKERHUB_USERNAME/quickstart:0.1"  # 👈 Update this line
secret_set = "quickstart-secrets"

[scaling]
	min_agents = 1
```

**Understanding the configuration:**

- `agent_name`: Your bot's name in Pipecat Cloud
- `image`: The Docker image to deploy (format: `username/image:version`)
- `secret_set`: Where your API keys are stored securely
- `min_agents`: Number of bot instances to keep ready (1 = instant start)

<Tip>
  [Set up
  `image_credentials`](/deployment/pipecat-cloud/fundamentals/secrets#image-pull-secrets)
  in your TOML file for authenticated image pulls.
</Tip>

### Configure secrets

Upload your API keys to Pipecat Cloud's secure storage:

```bash
uv run pipecat cloud secrets set quickstart-secrets --file .env
```

This creates a secret set called `quickstart-secrets` (matching your TOML file) and uploads all your API keys from `.env`.

### Build and deploy

1. Build and push your Docker image

```bash
uv run pipecat cloud docker build-push
```

This builds your Docker image and pushes it to Docker Hub based on the `image` information in your `pcc-deploy.toml` file.

2. Deploy to Pipecat Cloud

```bash
uv run pipecat cloud deploy
```

### Connect to your agent

1. Open your [Pipecat Cloud dashboard](https://pipecat.daily.co/)
2. Select your `quickstart` agent → **Sandbox**
3. Allow microphone access and click **Connect**

🎉 **Your bot is now live in production!**

## Understanding the Quickstart Bot

When you speak to your bot, here's the real-time pipeline that processes your conversation:

1. **Audio Capture**: Your browser captures microphone audio and sends it via WebRTC
2. **Voice Activity Detection**: Silero VAD detects when you start and stop speaking
3. **Speech Recognition**: Deepgram converts your speech to text in real-time
4. **Language Processing**: OpenAI's GPT model generates an intelligent response
5. **Speech Synthesis**: Cartesia converts the response text back to natural speech
6. **Audio Playback**: The generated audio streams back to your browser

Each step happens with minimal latency, typically completing the full round-trip in under one second.

### AI Services

Your bot uses three AI services, each configured with API keys from your `.env` file:

```python
# Create AI Services
stt = DeepgramSTTService(api_key=os.getenv("DEEPGRAM_API_KEY"))
tts = CartesiaTTSService(
    api_key=os.getenv("CARTESIA_API_KEY"),
    voice_id="71a7ad14-091c-4e8e-a314-022ece01c121",
)
llm = OpenAILLMService(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))
```

Pipecat supports many different AI services. You can swap out Deepgram for Azure Speech, OpenAI for Anthropic, or Cartesia for ElevenLabs without changing the rest of your code.

See the [supported services documentation](/server/services/supported-services) for all available options.

### Context and Messages

Your bot maintains conversation history using a context object, enabling multi-turn interactions where the bot remembers what was said earlier.

The context is initialized with a system message that defines the bot's personality:

```python
# All messages use the OpenAI message format
messages = [
    {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "You are a friendly AI assistant. Respond naturally and keep your answers conversational.",
    },
]

context = LLMContext(messages)
user_aggregator, assistant_aggregator = LLMContextAggregatorPair(
    context,
    user_params=LLMUserAggregatorParams(
        vad_analyzer=SileroVADAnalyzer(params=VADParams(stop_secs=0.2)),
    ),
)
```

The context aggregator automatically collects user messages (after speech-to-text) and assistant responses (after text-to-speech), maintaining the conversation flow without manual intervention.

### RTVI Protocol

When building web or mobile clients, you can use [Pipecat's client SDKs](/client/introduction) that communicate with your bot via the [RTVI (Real-Time Voice Interaction) protocol](/client/rtvi-standard). Pipecat comes with RTVI enabled by default, allowing your the Pipecat server and client to exchange messages and events in real-time.

### Pipeline Configuration

The core of your bot is a Pipeline that processes data through a series of processors:

```python
# Create the pipeline with the processors
pipeline = Pipeline([
    transport.input(),     # Receive audio from browser
    stt,                   # Speech-to-text (Deepgram)
    user_aggregator,       # Add user message to context
    llm,                   # Language model (OpenAI)
    tts,                   # Text-to-speech (Cartesia)
    transport.output(),    # Send audio back to browser
    assistant_aggregator,  # Add bot response to context
])
```

Data flows through the pipeline as "frames", objects containing audio, text, or other data types. The ordering is crucial: audio must be transcribed before it can be processed by the LLM, and text must be synthesized before it can be played back.

The pipeline is managed by a PipelineTask:

```python
# Create a PipelineTask to manage the pipeline execution
task = PipelineTask(
    pipeline,
    params=PipelineParams(
        enable_metrics=True,
        enable_usage_metrics=True,
    ),
)
```

The task handles pipeline execution, collects metrics, and manages RTVI events through [observers](/server/utilities/observers/observer-pattern).

### Event Handlers

Event handlers manage the bot's lifecycle and user interactions:

```python
# Event handler for when a client connects
@transport.event_handler("on_client_connected")
async def on_client_connected(transport, client):
    logger.info(f"Client connected")
    # Add a greeting message to the context
    messages.append({"role": "system", "content": "Say hello and briefly introduce yourself."})
    # Prompt the bot to start talking when the client connects
    await task.queue_frames([LLMRunFrame()])

# Event handler for when a client disconnects
@transport.event_handler("on_client_disconnected")
async def on_client_disconnected(transport, client):
    logger.info(f"Client disconnected")
    # Cancel the task when the client disconnects
    # This stops the pipeline and all processors, cleaning up resources
    await task.cancel()
```

When a client connects, the bot adds a greeting instruction and queues a context frame to initiate the conversation. When disconnecting, it properly cancels the task to clean up resources.

### Running the Pipeline

Finally, the pipeline is executed by a PipelineRunner:

```python
# Create a PipelineRunner to run the task
runner = PipelineRunner(handle_sigint=False)

# Finally, run the task using the runner
# This will start the pipeline and begin processing frames
await runner.run(task)
```

The runner manages the pipeline's execution lifecycle. Note that `handle_sigint=False` because the main runner handles system signals.

### Bot Entry Point

The quickstart uses Pipecat's runner system:

```python
async def bot(runner_args: RunnerArguments):
    """Main bot entry point."""

    # Configure transport parameters for different environments
    transport_params = {
        "daily": lambda: DailyParams(
            audio_in_enabled=True,
            audio_out_enabled=True,
        ),
        "webrtc": lambda: TransportParams(
            audio_in_enabled=True,
            audio_out_enabled=True,
        ),
    }

    transport = await create_transport(runner_args, transport_params)
    await run_bot(transport, runner_args)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    from pipecat.runner.run import main
    main()
```

This runner automatically handles WebRTC connection setup and management, making it easy to get started with minimal configuration. The same code works for both local development and production deployment.

<Tip>
  **Production ready**: This bot pattern is fully compatible with Pipecat Cloud,
  meaning you can deploy your bot without any code changes.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

- **Browser permissions**: Make sure to allow microphone access when prompted by your browser.
- **Connection issues**: If the WebRTC connection fails, first try a different browser. If that fails, make sure you don't have a VPN or firewall rules blocking traffic. WebRTC uses UDP to communicate.
- **Audio issues**: Check that your microphone and speakers are working and not muted.
