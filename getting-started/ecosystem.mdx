Pipecat provides a complete ecosystem of client SDKs, developer tools, and AI service integrations to build voice and multimodal applications for any platform.

## Client SDKs

The client SDKs connect users to your bot via mobile or web applications. They handle real-time audio transport (using Daily WebRTC, SmallWebRTC, etc.) and provide built-in messaging and events to build responsive voice AI interfaces—tracking when your bot is speaking, what it's saying, and more.

Build client applications for any platform with our official SDKs:

## AI Services

Pipecat is a modular system where you can plug in different AI services without changing your code. This flexibility is one of Pipecat's core strengths—swap Deepgram for Azure Speech, OpenAI for Anthropic, or Cartesia for ElevenLabs with minimal changes.

The framework integrates with 70+ services across:

- **Speech-to-Text (STT)** - Deepgram, Azure, Google, Whisper, and more
- **Language Models (LLM)** - OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Groq, and more
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** - Cartesia, ElevenLabs, Azure, Google, and more
- **Vision** - Image and video analysis capabilities
