Ready to build your own bot? The Pipecat CLI scaffolds complete projects tailored to your platform and use case.

<Note>
  **New to Pipecat?** We recommend completing the
  [Quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart) first to understand Pipecat basics
  before scaffolding your own project.
</Note>

## Install the Pipecat CLI

Install the CLI globally using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) or [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/):

```bash
uv tool install pipecat-ai-cli
# or
pipx install pipecat-ai-cli
```

Verify installation:

```bash
pipecat --version
```

## Create Your Project

Run the interactive setup wizard:

```bash
pipecat init
```

The CLI will guide you through selecting your platform (phone or web/mobile), transport provider, AI services (STT, LLM, TTS), and deployment target.
