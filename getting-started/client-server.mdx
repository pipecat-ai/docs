## Overview

Learn how to build web and mobile applications using Pipecat's client/server architecture. This approach separates your bot logic from your user interface, giving you full control over the client experience while maintaining real-time voice communication.

This guide introduces two key technologies that power client/server applications:

### Pipecat Client SDKs

Pipecat provides client SDKs for multiple platforms, all implementing the [RTVI (Real-Time Voice and Video Inference) standard](/client/rtvi-standard). These SDKs handle the complex real-time communication between your custom interface and your Pipecat bot.

**Key Benefits:**

- **Real-time communication**: Handle voice, video, and messaging in real-time
- **RTVI standard**: Open specification ensuring compatibility and consistency
- **Cross-platform**: Consistent API across all supported platforms
- **Production-ready**: Battle-tested for multimedia handling

### Voice UI Kit

The [Voice UI Kit](https://github.com/pipecat-ai/voice-ui-kit) provides React components and templates for quickly building voice AI interfaces. It's designed specifically to accelerate Pipecat application development.

**Key Features:**

- **Debug console**: Flexible UI for testing and benchmarking your bots
- **Headless components**: Building blocks for custom voice interfaces
- **Drop-in templates**: Fully-featured UIs ready for development and demos
- **Fully customizable**: Built on Tailwind with CSS variables for easy theming
- **Responsive design**: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile

## React + SmallWebRTC Example

This example demonstrates a React client using the Voice UI Kit's console template, connected to a Pipecat bot server via SmallWebRTC transport.

## Prerequisites

### Python 3.10+

Pipecat requires Python 3.10 or newer. Check your version with:

```bash
python --version
```

If you need to upgrade Python, we recommend using a version manager like `uv` or `pyenv`.

### Node.js 16+

The React client requires Node.js 16 or newer. Check your version with:

```bash
node --version
```

### AI Service API Keys

## Setup

This example requires running both a server and client in **two separate terminal windows**.

### 1. Clone the quickstart repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat-quickstart-client-server.git
cd pipecat-quickstart-client-server
```

### 2. Set up the server (Terminal 1)

Navigate to the server directory and set up your environment:

```bash
cd server
```

Create your environment file:

```bash
cp env.example .env
```

Open the `.env` file and add your API keys:

```bash
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_deepgram_api_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
CARTESIA_API_KEY=your_cartesia_api_key
```

Set up your virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<Tip>
  **Using `uv`?** Create and activate with: `uv venv && source
  .venv/bin/activate`, then install with: `uv pip install -r requirements.txt`
</Tip>

Run your bot server:

```bash
python bot.py
```

<Tip>**Using `uv`?** Run with: `uv run bot.py`</Tip>

You should see output confirming your server is running and ready to receive connections.

### 3. Set up the client (Terminal 2)

In a new terminal window, navigate to the client directory:

```bash
cd client
```

Install client dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see output like:

```

  VITE v6.2.5  ready in 5957 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
  ➜  press h + enter to show help

```

### 4. Connect and test

**Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser**. You'll see the Voice UI Kit console interface with a connect button.

Click **Connect** and allow microphone access when prompted. The console will establish a connection to your bot server and you can start having a voice conversation!

## Understanding the Architecture

### Transport Layer

Both the client and server use the **SmallWebRTC transport**, which enables:

- **Bidirectional audio communication**: Real-time voice data flows between client and server
- **Bidirectional events and messaging**: RTVI protocol messages for coordination and control
- **Synchronized state**: Client and server stay in sync throughout the conversation

### Client Implementation

The React client uses the Voice UI Kit's `ConsoleTemplate` component:

```tsx
import {
  ConsoleTemplate,
  FullScreenContainer,
  ThemeProvider,
} from "@pipecat-ai/voice-ui-kit";

createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!).render(
  <StrictMode>
    <ThemeProvider>
      <FullScreenContainer>
        <ConsoleTemplate
          transportType="smallwebrtc"
          connectParams={{
            connectionUrl: "/api/offer",
          }}
        />
      </FullScreenContainer>
    </ThemeProvider>
  </StrictMode>
);
```

**Key Points:**

- **Full-page experience**: The console template provides a complete interface for voice interaction
- **Custom UI building**: The Voice UI Kit also offers individual components for building custom interfaces
- **Transport configuration**: The client connects to the `/api/offer` endpoint provided by the server

### Server Implementation

The server uses Pipecat's [development runner](/server/utilities/runner/guide), which automatically provides:

- **FastAPI server**: Handles HTTP requests and WebRTC connections
- **WebRTC endpoint**: The `/api/offer` endpoint that clients connect to
- **Connection management**: Automatic setup and teardown of client connections

<Note>
  This is the same server-side Pipecat bot from the [Quickstart
  example](/getting-started/quickstart).
</Note>

## Building for Other Platforms

This example uses React and SmallWebRTC, but Pipecat's client SDKs work across platforms with the same server-side bot code. The RTVI standard ensures consistent communication regardless of which client SDK you use.

<Card

>
  See the same bot working with 6 different client implementations: JavaScript,
  React, iOS (Swift), Android (Kotlin), React Native, and Daily Prebuilt
</Card>

**Key advantages:**

- **Write once, deploy everywhere**: Your Pipecat server works with any client platform
- **Consistent experience**: RTVI protocol ensures uniform behavior across platforms
- **Easy migration**: Switch between client platforms without changing server code

## Deployment Considerations

### Local Development

- **Client connects to local server**: The development runner provides all necessary endpoints
- **Automatic setup**: No additional configuration needed beyond API keys

### Pipecat Cloud Deployment

- **Server**: Deploy your bot code as-is to Pipecat Cloud
- **Client**: Update connection endpoint to your web server, which then connects to Pipecat Cloud's `/{agent}/start` endpoint
- **API key security**: Your web server keeps API keys secret from the client

### Self-Hosting

- **Custom server setup**: Implement your own FastAPI or similar server
- **Connection handling**: Handle bot startup and WebRTC connection management
- **Similar pattern**: Web server receives client connections, then starts bot instances

<Note>
  A web server layer is required in production to keep your AI service API keys
  secure and never expose them to client-side code.
</Note>

## Next Steps

Now that you have a working client/server application:

- **Customize the interface**: Explore Voice UI Kit components to build custom interfaces beyond the console template
- **Try other platforms**: Check out the iOS, Android, and React Native client SDKs
- **Join the community**: Connect with other developers on [Discord](https://discord.gg/pipecat) to share your projects and get help
