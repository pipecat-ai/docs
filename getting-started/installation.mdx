## Accounts you'll need (or want)

While you can use Pipecat without them, there are a few third-party services you'll probably want to use with Pipecat. We recommend these to start, since they're easy to sign up and get started for free or low cost:

- [Daily](https://dashboard.daily.co/u/signup?pipecat=true) for your transport layer—handling real-time audio, video, and data exchange between the bot and user through WebRTC.
- [Cartesia](https://play.cartesia.ai/), [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/sign-up), or [Deepgram](https://console.deepgram.com/signup) for text-to-speech.
- [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/signup) gets you ChatGPT for an LLM, and DALL-E for image generation.

If you're going to run the quickstart, you'll want to get started with Cartesia.

## Installing Pipecat

To start, we recommend using a virtual environment, or `venv`, inside a new directory:

```bash
mkdir pipecat-test
cd pipecat-test
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

The `pipecat-ai` Python module has a lot of optional dependencies, including some pretty big AI libraries. This allows you to only install what you need. For example, to install `pipecat-ai` along with support for the services above, run this command (or add it to your `requirements.txt`):

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Cartesia">```pip install "pipecat-ai[daily,cartesia]" ```</Tab>
  <Tab title="ElevenLabs">
    ```pip install "pipecat-ai[daily,elevenlabs]" ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Deepgram">```pip install "pipecat-ai[daily,deepgram]" ```</Tab>
</Tabs>

Some services, like Cartesia, ElevenLabs and Deepgram, just use built-in Python functionality for REST requests, so they don't have anything extra to install.

You can always install other dependencies later. For the full list, look for the `[project.optional-dependencies]` section in [pyproject.toml](https://github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat/blob/main/pyproject.toml).

## Service Configuration

### Daily Setup

Head over to [dashboard.daily.co/rooms](https://dashboard.daily.co/rooms) and create a new room. You can leave everything as-is in the room creation screen, or change anything you want. (Emoji reactions and advanced chat are fun.) Make note of:

- Your room URL: `https://YOURDOMAIN.daily.co/YOURROOM`
- Your API key from [dashboard.daily.co/developers](https://dashboard.daily.co/developers)

### Text-to-Speech Setup

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Using Cartesia">
        Find in [Cartesia Voice library](https://play.cartesia.ai/library) a voice
        that you like. Then click the three dots at the end and select `Copy Id`.

        Then, head over to [Cartesia API keys](https://play.cartesia.ai/keys) and create your API key.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Using ElevenLabs">
        Next, head over to [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/app/voice-lab) and find a voice you want to use. Make note of the Voice ID, and get your API key from your user avatar on the bottom left.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Using Deepgram">
        Check all the voices available in [Deepgram](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/tts-models), find your favorite and note the model name. For example `aura-arcas-en`.
        Then, head over to your [Deepgram project](https://console.deepgram.com/) and create an API key.
    </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in your project directory with your service credentials:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Cartesia">

    ```env
    DAILY_SAMPLE_ROOM_URL=https://YOURDOMAIN.daily.co/YOURROOM
    DAILY_API_KEY=your_daily_api_key
    CARTESIA_API_KEY=your_cartesia_api_key
    CARTESIA_VOICE_ID=your_voice_id
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="ElevenLabs">

    ```env
    DAILY_SAMPLE_ROOM_URL=https://YOURDOMAIN.daily.co/YOURROOM
    DAILY_API_KEY=your_daily_api_key
    ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key
    ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID=your_voice_id
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Deepgram">
    
    ```env
    DAILY_SAMPLE_ROOM_URL=https://YOURDOMAIN.daily.co/YOURROOM
    DAILY_API_KEY=your_daily_api_key
    DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_deepgram_api_key
