description: "Pipecat is a framework for building voice-enabled, real-time, multimodal AI applications"
---

Pipecat is an open source Python framework that handles the complex orchestration of AI services, network transport, audio processing, and multimodal interactions. "Multimodal" means you can use any combination of audio, video, images, and/or text in your interactions. And "real-time" means that things are happening quickly enough that it feels conversational—a "back-and-forth" with a bot, not submitting a query and waiting for results.

## How It Works

The flow of interactions in a Pipecat application is typically straightforward:

1. The bot says something
2. The user says something
3. The bot says something
4. The user says something

This continues until the conversation naturally ends. While this flow seems simple, making it feel natural requires sophisticated real-time processing.

### Real-time Processing

Pipecat's pipeline architecture handles both simple voice interactions and complex multimodal processing. Let's look at how data flows through the system:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Voice app">
    <Steps>
        <Step title="Send Audio">
            Transmit and capture streamed audio from the user
        </Step>
        <Step title="Transcribe Speech">
            Convert speech to text as the user is talking
        </Step>
        <Step title="Process with LLM">
            Generate responses using a large language model
        </Step>
        <Step title="Convert to Speech">
            Transform text responses into natural speech
        </Step>
        <Step title="Play Audio">Stream the audio response back to the user</Step>
    </Steps>
</Tab>

<Tab title="Multimodal app">
    <Steps>
        <Step title="Send Audio and Video">
            Transmit and capture audio, video, and image inputs simultaneously
        </Step>
        <Step title="Process Streams">Handle multiple input streams in parallel</Step>
        <Step title="Model Processing">
            Send combined inputs to multimodal models (like GPT-4V)
        </Step>
        <Step title="Generate Outputs">
            Create various outputs (text, images, audio, etc.)
        </Step>
        <Step title="Coordinate Presentation">
            Synchronize and present multiple output types
        </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

In both cases, Pipecat:

- Processes responses as they stream in
- Handles multiple input/output modalities concurrently
- Manages resource allocation and synchronization
- Coordinates parallel processing tasks

This architecture creates fluid, natural interactions without noticeable delays, whether you're building a simple voice assistant or a complex multimodal application. Pipecat's pipeline architecture is particularly valuable for managing the complexity of real-time, multimodal interactions, ensuring smooth data flow and proper synchronization regardless of the input/output types involved.

<Note>
  Pipecat handles all this complexity for you, letting you focus on building
  your application rather than managing the underlying infrastructure.
