## Overview

Pipecat provides an event system that lets you hook into lifecycle changes across the framework — pipeline state transitions, service connections, transport activity, conversation turns, errors, and more.

Events are available on most Pipecat objects (anything that inherits from `BaseObject`). You register handlers using the `@event_handler` decorator, and Pipecat calls them automatically when things happen.

```python
@task.event_handler("on_pipeline_started")
async def on_pipeline_started(task, frame):
    print("Pipeline is running!")

@tts.event_handler("on_connected")
async def on_tts_connected(service):
    print(f"TTS service connected: {service}")
```

## Registering Event Handlers

Use the `@event_handler` decorator on the object that emits the event:

```python
@object.event_handler("event_name")
async def handler(object, ...):
    # Handle the event
    ...
```

The first parameter is always the object that emitted the event. Additional parameters depend on the specific event.

You can also register handlers without the decorator:

```python
async def my_handler(object, ...):
    ...

object.add_event_handler("event_name", my_handler)
```

Handlers can be either `async` or synchronous functions — Pipecat detects which and calls them appropriately.

### Multiple Handlers

You can register multiple handlers for the same event. They execute in the order they were registered:

```python
@task.event_handler("on_pipeline_finished")
async def log_finished(task, frame):
    print("Pipeline finished (handler 1)")

@task.event_handler("on_pipeline_finished")
async def cleanup(task, frame):
    print("Cleaning up (handler 2)")
```

## Synchronous vs Asynchronous Events

Events are either **synchronous** or **asynchronous**, depending on how the component registered them internally:

- **Synchronous events** (`sync=True`) run the handler inline — the caller waits for the handler to complete before continuing. These are used for events that must complete immediately, such as frame processing hooks and error handling. Synchronous event handlers should execute fast to avoid blocking the pipeline.

- **Asynchronous events** (default) run the handler in a background `asyncio.Task`. The caller continues immediately. These are used for events where you might do I/O, logging, or other work that shouldn't block the pipeline.

<Note>
You don't need to choose — the sync/async behavior is determined by the component, not by your handler. Your handler can be an `async def` or a regular `def` regardless.
</Note>

## Events Reference

The table below lists all events available in Pipecat, grouped by component. Click through to the linked documentation for full details including handler signatures and usage examples.

### Pipeline
