## Overview

Smart Turn Detection is an advanced feature in Pipecat that determines when a user has finished speaking and the bot should respond. Unlike basic Voice Activity Detection (VAD) which only detects speech vs. non-speech, Smart Turn Detection uses a machine learning model to recognize natural conversational cues like intonation patterns and linguistic signals.

Pipecat provides two implementations of Smart Turn Detection:

1. **LocalSmartTurnAnalyzerV3** - Runs inference locally using ONNX. This method is recommended due to the fast CPU inference times in Smart Turn v3.
2. **FalSmartTurnAnalyzer** - Uses Fal's hosted smart-turn model for inference.


All implementations share the same underlying API and parameters, making it easy to switch between them based on your deployment requirements.

## Installation

The Smart Turn Detection feature requires additional dependencies depending on which implementation you choose.

**For local inference:**

```bash
pip install "pipecat-ai[local-smart-turn-v3]"
```

The Smart Turn model weights are bundled with Pipecat, so no need to download these separately.

**For Fal's hosted service inference:**

```bash
pip install "pipecat-ai[remote-smart-turn]"
```

## Integration with Transport

Smart Turn Detection is integrated into your application by setting one of the available turn analyzers as the `turn_analyzer` parameter in your transport configuration:

```python
from pipecat.transports.base_transport import TransportParams

transport = SmallWebRTCTransport(
    webrtc_connection=webrtc_connection,
    params=TransportParams(
        audio_in_enabled=True,
        vad_analyzer=SileroVADAnalyzer(params=VADParams(stop_secs=0.2)),
        turn_analyzer=LocalSmartTurnAnalyzerV3(),
    ),
)
```

<Tip>
  Smart Turn Detection requires VAD to be enabled and works best when the VAD analyzer is set to a short `stop_secs` value. We recommend 0.2 seconds.

```python
audio_in_enabled=True,
vad_analyzer=SileroVADAnalyzer(params=VADParams(stop_secs=0.2))
```

</Tip>

## Configuration

All implementations use the same `SmartTurnParams` class to configure behavior:

<ParamField path="stop_secs" type="float" default="3.0">
  Duration of silence in seconds required before triggering a silence-based end
  of turn
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="pre_speech_ms" type="float" default="0.0">
  Amount of audio (in milliseconds) to include before speech is detected
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="max_duration_secs" type="float" default="8.0">
  Maximum allowed segment duration in seconds. For segments longer than this
  value, a rolling window is used.
</ParamField>

## Remote Smart Turn

The `FalSmartTurnAnalyzer` class uses a remote service for turn detection inference.

### Constructor Parameters

<ParamField path="url" type="str" required>
  The URL of the remote Smart Turn service
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="sample_rate" type="Optional[int]" default="None">
  Audio sample rate (will be set by the transport if not provided)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="params" type="SmartTurnParams" default="SmartTurnParams()">
  Configuration parameters for turn detection
</ParamField>

### Example

```python
import os
from pipecat.audio.turn.smart_turn.fal_smart_turn import FalSmartTurnAnalyzer
from pipecat.audio.turn.smart_turn.base_smart_turn import SmartTurnParams
from pipecat.transports.base_transport import TransportParams

# Get the URL for the remote Smart Turn service
remote_smart_turn_url = os.getenv("REMOTE_SMART_TURN_URL")

# Create the transport with Smart Turn detection
transport = SmallWebRTCTransport(
    webrtc_connection=webrtc_connection,
    params=TransportParams(
        audio_in_enabled=True,
        audio_out_enabled=True,
        vad_analyzer=SileroVADAnalyzer(params=VADParams(stop_secs=0.2)),
        turn_analyzer=FalSmartTurnAnalyzer(
            url=remote_smart_turn_url,
            params=SmartTurnParams(
                stop_secs=3.0,
                pre_speech_ms=0.0,
                max_duration_secs=8.0
            )
        ),
    ),
)
```


## Local Smart Turn

The `LocalSmartTurnAnalyzerV3` runs inference locally. Version 3 of the model supports fast CPU inference on ordinary cloud instances.

### Constructor Parameters

<ParamField
  path="smart_turn_model_path"
  type="Optional[str]"
  default="None"
>
  Path to the Smart Turn v3 ONNX file containing the model weights. Download this from
  https://huggingface.co/pipecat-ai/smart-turn-v3/tree/main

  This parameter is optional, as Pipecat includes a copy of the model internally, and this
  is used if the path is unset.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="sample_rate" type="Optional[int]" default="None">
  Audio sample rate (will be set by the transport if not provided)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="params" type="SmartTurnParams" default="SmartTurnParams()">
  Configuration parameters for turn detection
</ParamField>

### Example

```python
from pipecat.audio.turn.smart_turn.local_smart_turn_v3 import LocalSmartTurnAnalyzerV3
from pipecat.transports.base_transport import TransportParams

# Create the transport with Smart Turn detection
transport = SmallWebRTCTransport(
    webrtc_connection=webrtc_connection,
    params=TransportParams(
        audio_in_enabled=True,
        audio_out_enabled=True,
        vad_analyzer=SileroVADAnalyzer(params=VADParams(stop_secs=0.2)),
        turn_analyzer=LocalSmartTurnAnalyzerV3(),
    ),
)
```


## How It Works

Smart Turn Detection continuously analyzes audio streams to identify natural turn completion points:

1. **Audio Buffering**: The system continuously buffers audio with timestamps, maintaining a small buffer of pre-speech audio.

2. **VAD Processing**: Voice Activity Detection (using the Silero model) detects when there is a pause in the user's speech.

3. **Smart Turn Analysis**: When VAD detects a pause in speech, the Smart Turn model analyzes the audio from the most recent 8 seconds of the user's turn, and makes a decision about whether the turn is complete or incomplete.

The system includes a fallback mechanism: if a turn is classified as incomplete but silence continues for longer than `stop_secs`, the turn is automatically marked as complete.

## Notes

- The model supports 23 languages, see the [source repository](https://github.com/pipecat-ai/smart-turn) for more details
- You can adjust the `stop_secs` parameter based on your application's needs for responsiveness
- Smart Turn generally provides a more natural conversational experience but is computationally more intensive than simple VAD
- `LocalSmartTurnAnalyzerV3` is designed to run on CPU, and inference can be performed on low-cost cloud instances in under 100ms. However, by installing the `onnxruntime-gpu` dependency, you can achieve higher performance by making use of GPU inference.
