title: "MCPClient"
description: "Service to connect to MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers"
---

## Overview

MCP is an open standard for enabling AI agents to interact with external data and tools. `MCPClient` provides a way to access and call tools via MCP. For example, instead of writing bespoke function call implementations for an external API, you may use an MCP server that provides a bridge to the API. _Be aware there may be security implications._ See [MCP documenation](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol) for more details.

## Installation

To use `MCPClient`, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install "pipecat-ai[mcp]"
```

You may also need to set environment variables as required by the specific MCP server to which you are connecting.

## Configuration

### Constructor Parameters

You can connect to your MCP server via Stdio or SSE transport. See [here](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/transports#built-in-transport-types) for more documentation on MCP transports.

<ParamField path="server_params" type="str | StdioServerParameters" required>

You can provide either:

- URL: "https://your.mcp.server/sse"
- StdioServerParameters, which are defined as:

```python
  StdioServerParameters(
        command="python",  # Executable
        args=["example_server.py"],  # Optional command line arguments
        env=None,  # Optional environment variables
    )
```

</ParamField>

### Input Parameters

See more information regarding server params [here](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk?tab=readme-ov-file#writing-mcp-clients).

## Usage Example

### MCP Stdio Transport Implementation

```python

# Import MCPClient and StdioServerParameters
...
from mcp import StdioServerParameters
from pipecat.services.mcp_service import MCPClient
...

# Initialize an LLM
llm = ...

# Initialize and configure MCPClient with server parameters
mcp = MCPClient(
        server_params=StdioServerParameters(
            command=shutil.which("npx"),
            args=["-y", "@name/mcp-server-name@latest"],
            env={"ENV_API_KEY": "<env_api_key>"},
        )
    )

# Create tools schema from the MCP server and register them with llm
tools = await mcp.register_tools(llm)

# Create context with system message and tools
# Tip: Let the LLM know it has access to tools from an MCP server by including it in the system prompt.
context = LLMContext(
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are a helpful assistant in a voice conversation. You have access to MCP tools. Keep responses concise."
        }
    ],
    tools=tools
)
```

### MCP SSE Transport Implementation

```python

# Import MCPClient
...
from pipecat.services.mcp_service import MCPClient
...

# Initialize an LLM
llm = ...

# Initialize and configure MCPClient with MCP SSE server url
mcp = MCPClient(server_params="https://your.mcp.server/sse")

# Create tools schema from the MCP server and register them with llm
tools = await mcp.register_tools(llm)

# Create context with system message and tools
# Tip: Let the LLM know it has access to tools from an MCP server by including it in the system prompt.
context = LLMContext(
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are a helpful assistant in a voice conversation. You have access to MCP tools. Keep responses concise."
        }
    ],
    tools=tools
)
```

## Methods

<ResponseField name="register_tools" type="async method">
  Converts MCP tools to Pipecat-friendly function definitions and registers the
  functions with the llm.
</ResponseField>

```python
async def register_tools(self, llm) -> ToolsSchema:
```
