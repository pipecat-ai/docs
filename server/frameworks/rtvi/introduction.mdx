Pipecat's RTVI (Real-Time Voice Interaction) protocol provides a standardized communication layer between clients and servers for building real-time voice and multimodal applications. It handles the synchronization of user and bot interactions, transcriptions, LLM processing, and text-to-speech delivery.

This page provides an overview of RTVI from the server's perspective and how to use it in your bot applications.

  A complete specification of the RTVI protocol for client-server communication.
</Card>

## Architecture

RTVI operates with two primary components, both of which are required for full functionality:

1. [**RTVIProcessor**](./rtvi-processor) - A frame processor residing in the pipeline that serves as the entry point for sending and receiving messages to/from the client.

2. [**RTVIObserver**](./rtvi-observer) - An observer that monitors pipeline events and translates them into client-compatible messages, handling:
   - Speaking state changes
   - Transcription updates
   - LLM responses
   - TTS events
   - Performance metrics

## Basic Example

Here's how to set up RTVI in your Pipecat application:

```python
from pipecat.processors.frameworks.rtvi import RTVIObserver, RTVIProcessor

# Create the RTVI processor
rtvi = RTVIProcessor()

# Include the RTVIProcessor in your pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline(
    [
        transport.input(),
        rtvi,
        stt,
        context_aggregator.user(),
        llm,
        tts,
        transport.output(),
        context_aggregator.assistant(),
    ]
)

# Add the RTVIObserver to your pipeline task
task = PipelineTask(
    pipeline,
    params=PipelineParams(enable_metrics=True),
    observers=[RTVIObserver(rtvi)],
)

# Handle client connection
@rtvi.event_handler("on_client_ready")
async def on_client_ready(rtvi):
    # Signal bot is ready to receive messages
    await rtvi.set_bot_ready()
    # Initialize the conversation
    await task.queue_frames([LLMRunFrame()])

# Handle participant disconnection
@transport.event_handler("on_participant_left")
async def on_participant_left(transport, participant, reason):
    await task.cancel()

# Run the pipeline
runner = PipelineRunner()
await runner.run(task)
```

## Protocol Flow

1. Client connects and sends a `client-ready` message
2. Server responds with `bot-ready` and initial configuration
3. Client and server exchange real-time events:
   - Speaking state changes (`user/bot-started/stopped-speaking`)
   - Transcriptions (`user-transcription/bot-output`)
   - LLM processing (`bot-llm-started/stopped`, `bot-llm-text`, `llm-function-call`)
   - TTS events (`bot-tts-started/stopped`, `bot-tts-text`, `bot-tts-audio`)

## Client Integration

RTVI is implemented in Pipecat client SDKs, providing a high-level API to interact with the protocol. Visit the Pipecat Client SDKs documentation:
