## Overview

`PerplexityLLMService` provides access to Perplexity's language models through an OpenAI-compatible interface. It inherits from `OpenAILLMService` and supports streaming responses and context management, with special handling for Perplexity's incremental token reporting and built-in internet search capabilities.

## Installation

To use Perplexity services, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install "pipecat-ai[perplexity]"
```

## Prerequisites

### Perplexity Account Setup

Before using Perplexity LLM services, you need:

1. **Perplexity Account**: Sign up at [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/)
2. **API Key**: Generate an API key from your account dashboard
3. **Model Selection**: Choose from available models with built-in search capabilities

### Required Environment Variables

- `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`: Your Perplexity API key for authentication

<Note>
  Unlike other LLM services, Perplexity does not support function calling.
  Instead, they offer native internet search built in without requiring special
  function calls.
