## Overview

Deepgram provides two STT service implementations:

- `DeepgramSTTService` for real-time speech recognition using Deepgram's standard WebSocket API with support for interim results, language detection, and voice activity detection (VAD)
- `DeepgramFluxSTTService` for advanced conversational AI with Flux capabilities including intelligent turn detection, eager end-of-turn events, and enhanced speech processing for improved response timing.
