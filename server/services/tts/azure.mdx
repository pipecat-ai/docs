## Overview

Azure Cognitive Services provides high-quality text-to-speech synthesis with two service implementations: `AzureTTSService` (WebSocket-based) for real-time streaming with low latency, and `AzureHttpTTSService` (HTTP-based) for batch synthesis. `AzureTTSService` is recommended for interactive applications requiring streaming capabilities.
