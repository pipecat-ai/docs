## Overview

`DailyTransport` provides real-time audio and video communication using Daily's hosted WebRTC platform. It handles bidirectional media streams, participant management, transcription, recording, and telephony features without requiring your own WebRTC infrastructure. Daily manages all the complexity of WebRTC connections, NAT traversal, and global media routing.

## Installation

To use `DailyTransport`, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install "pipecat-ai[daily]"
```

## Prerequisites

### Daily Account Setup

Before using DailyTransport, you need:

1. **Daily Account**: Sign up at [Daily Dashboard](https://dashboard.daily.co/u/signup?pipecat=true)
2. **API Key**: Generate a Daily API key from your dashboard
3. **Room Creation**: Daily rooms must be created before connecting (see Usage section)

### Required Environment Variables

- `DAILY_API_KEY`: Your Daily API key for room creation and management

## Key Features

- **Hosted WebRTC**: No infrastructure setup required - Daily handles all WebRTC complexity
- **Multi-participant Support**: Handle multiple participants with individual audio/video tracks
- **Built-in Transcription**: Real-time speech-to-text with Deepgram integration
- **Telephony Integration**: [Dial-in/dial-out support for phone numbers via [SIP](/guides/telephony/twilio-daily-sip)/[PSTN](/guides/telephony/daily-pstn)
- **Recording & Streaming**: Built-in call recording and live streaming capabilities
- **Global Infrastructure**: Daily's edge network ensures low latency worldwide
- **Advanced Controls**: Participant management, permissions, and media routing

## Usage

DailyTransport connects your Pipecat bot to Daily rooms where it can communicate with participants through audio, video, and data channels. Rooms must be created using the Daily API before your bot can join.

The transport integrates with Pipecat's pipeline to process participant audio through your STT, LLM, and TTS services, then send responses back to participants.

See the [complete example](https://github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat/blob/main/examples/foundational/04a-transports-daily.py) for a full implementation including:

- Daily room creation and token management
- Transport configuration with transcription and VAD
- Pipeline integration with participant event handling
- Advanced features like recording and dial-out
