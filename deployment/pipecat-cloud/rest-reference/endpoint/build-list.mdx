## Filtering Builds

Use query parameters to filter and paginate your build list:

```bash
# List all successful builds
curl "https://api.pipecat.daily.co/v1/builds?status=success" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PIPECAT_API_KEY"

# List builds in a specific region
curl "https://api.pipecat.daily.co/v1/builds?region=us-west&limit=10" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PIPECAT_API_KEY"

# Find builds with a specific context hash
curl "https://api.pipecat.daily.co/v1/builds?contextHash=a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PIPECAT_API_KEY"
```

## Pagination

Results are paginated with `limit` and `offset` parameters:

```bash
# Get page 2 (items 21-40)
curl "https://api.pipecat.daily.co/v1/builds?limit=20&offset=20" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PIPECAT_API_KEY"
```

The response includes `total` to help calculate pagination:

```json
{
  "builds": [...],
  "total": 142,
  "limit": 20,
  "offset": 20
}
```
