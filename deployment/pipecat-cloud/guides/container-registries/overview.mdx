When deploying agents to Pipecat Cloud, you can use images from both public and private container registries. While public images work out of the box, private images from any registry (including Docker Hub) require authentication setup.

## Public vs Private Images

**Public images** from any registry, including Docker Hub, work with Pipecat Cloud without additional configuration. However, **we strongly recommend using private images** for better data privacy and security when deploying production agents.

For **Docker Hub specifically**, even when using public images, we recommend setting up image pull secrets due to Docker Hub's low rate limits for unauthenticated pulls. See our [Image pull secrets guide](../../fundamentals/secrets#image-pull-secrets) for setup instructions.

## Private Registry Setup

For **private images** from any registry (including private Docker Hub repositories), you'll need to configure image pull secrets for authentication.

### Docker Hub Private Images

For private Docker Hub repositories, see the [Image pull secrets section](../../fundamentals/secrets#image-pull-secrets) in our Secrets guide for complete setup instructions.

### Other Private Registries

For other private registry providers, choose your platform below for detailed setup instructions:

## General Process

All private registry integrations follow a similar pattern:

1. **Authenticate Docker** with your registry locally
2. **Create image credentials** in Pipecat Cloud using the CLI
3. **Reference credentials** in your deployment configuration
4. **Deploy your agent** using the private image

```bash
# Create image pull secret
pipecat cloud secrets image-pull-secret my-registry-creds https://your-registry-url
```

Then configure your `pcc-deploy.toml` file:

```toml
agent_name = "my-agent"
image = "your-registry-url/my-agent:tag"
image_credentials = "my-registry-creds"
secret_set = "my-secrets"

[scaling]
    min_agents = 0
```

Finally, deploy:

```bash
pipecat cloud deploy
```

## Need Another Registry?

If you're using a different container registry (Azure Container Registry, GitHub Container Registry, Harbor, etc.), the general process above applies. The main differences are typically in the authentication method and registry URL format.
