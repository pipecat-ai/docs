Pipecat Cloud supports deploying agents to geographic regions, allowing you to reduce latency for your users and meet data residency requirements.

## Available Regions

You can view all available regions using the CLI:

```bash
pipecat cloud regions list
```

Or via the [REST API](/deployment/pipecat-cloud/rest-reference/endpoint/regions-list).

Available regions include:

- **us-west**: US West (Oregon)
- **us-east**: US East (Virginia)
- **eu-central**: Europe (Frankfurt)
- **ap-south**: Asia Pacific (Mumbai)

## Regional Requirements

When deploying agents and managing secrets, keep these requirements in mind:

- **Agent names are globally unique**: Each agent must have a unique name across all regions
- **Secret sets are region-specific**: Create a separate secret set in each region where you deploy agents
- **Image pull secrets are region-specific**: Create separate image pull secrets in each region if using private registries
- **Secrets must match agent regions**: An agent can only use secrets and image pull secrets from the same region
- **Default region is `us-west`**: If you don't specify a region, resources are created in `us-west`

## Deploying to Multiple Regions

To serve users in multiple geographic regions, deploy separate agents to each target region. Use region-specific naming for agents and secrets (e.g., `my-agent-us-west`, `my-secrets-us-west`).

### Example

Deploy two agents to two different regions: one in US West and one in EU Central.

```bash
# Create secrets in US West
pipecat cloud secrets set my-secrets-us-west API_KEY=xxx --region us-west
pipecat cloud secrets image-pull-secret dockerhub-creds-us-west \
  https://index.docker.io/v1/ \
  --region us-west

# Deploy agent in US West
pipecat cloud deploy my-agent-us-west my-image:latest \
  --region us-west \
  --secrets my-secrets-us-west \
  --credentials dockerhub-creds-us-west

# Create secrets in EU Central
pipecat cloud secrets set my-secrets-eu-central API_KEY=xxx --region eu-central
pipecat cloud secrets image-pull-secret dockerhub-creds-eu-central \
  https://index.docker.io/v1/ \
  --region eu-central

# Deploy agent in EU Central
pipecat cloud deploy my-agent-eu-central my-image:latest \
  --region eu-central \
  --secrets my-secrets-eu-central \
  --credentials dockerhub-creds-eu-central
```

Your application logic determines which regional agent to connect users to based on their location, preferences, or latency.
