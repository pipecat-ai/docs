Pipecat Cloud supports deploying agents to geographic regions, allowing you to reduce latency for your users and meet data residency requirements.

## Available Regions

You can view all available regions using the CLI:

```bash
pipecat cloud regions list
```

Or via the [REST API](/deployment/pipecat-cloud/rest-reference/endpoint/regions-list).

Available regions include:

- **us-west**: US West (Oregon)
- **us-east**: US East (Virginia)
- **eu-central**: Europe (Frankfurt)
- **ap-south**: Asia Pacific (Mumbai)

## Regional Requirements

When deploying agents and managing secrets, keep these requirements in mind:

- **Agent names are globally unique**: Each agent must have a unique name across all regions
- **Secret sets are region-specific**: Create a separate secret set in each region where you deploy agents
- **Image pull secrets are region-specific**: Create separate image pull secrets in each region if using private registries
- **Secrets must match agent regions**: An agent can only use secrets and image pull secrets from the same region

## Setting a Default Region

You can specify a default region for your organization via the [REST API](/deployment/pipecat-cloud/rest-reference/endpoint/properties-update) or the [CLI](/cli/cloud/organizations#default-region). If you don't specify a region, resources are created in your organization's default region.

## Deploying an Agent to a Region

This walkthrough will guide you through deploying an agent to a specific region.

### Step 1: Build and Push Your Docker Image

Build your agent Docker image and push it to a container registry. This guide assumes you already have a working agent image.

<Tip>
  Need help building agent images? See [Agent
  Images](/deployment/pipecat-cloud/fundamentals/agent-images) for detailed
  instructions.
</Tip>

### Step 2: Create a Secret Set

Create a secret set in your target region with the environment variables your agent needs.

```bash
pipecat cloud secrets set my-agent-secrets \
  OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxx \
  DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=xxx \
  --region us-east
```

<Tip>
  Learn more about managing secrets in the
  [Secrets](/deployment/pipecat-cloud/fundamentals/secrets) guide.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Create an Image Pull Secret

If you're using a private container registry, create an image pull secret in the same region.

```bash
pipecat cloud secrets image-pull-secret my-registry-creds \
  https://index.docker.io/v1/ \
  --region us-east
```

When prompted, enter your registry username and access token.

<Note>
  Using a public registry? You can skip this step and omit `image_credentials`
  from your deployment configuration.
</Note>

### Step 4: Create a Deployment Configuration

Create a `pcc-deploy.toml` file in your project directory:

```toml
agent_name = "my-agent"
image = "your-username/my-agent:latest"
region = "us-east"
secret_set = "my-agent-secrets"
image_credentials = "my-registry-creds"
agent_profile = "agent-1x"

[scaling]
min_agents = 1
max_agents = 10
```

<Tip>
  See the [deploy command
  reference](/cli/cloud/deploy#configuration-file-pcc-deploytoml) for all
  available configuration options.
</Tip>

### Step 5: Deploy Your Agent

Deploy your agent using the configuration file:

```bash
pipecat cloud deploy
```

The CLI will read your `pcc-deploy.toml` file and deploy the agent to the specified region. Once the deployment is ready, you can start sessions with your agent.

## Deploying to Multiple Regions

To serve users globally, repeat the steps above for each target region. Use region-specific naming for agents, secrets, and image pull secrets (e.g., `my-agent-us-east`, `my-agent-secrets-us-east`).

Your application determines which regional agent to connect users to based on their location, preferences, or latency requirements.
