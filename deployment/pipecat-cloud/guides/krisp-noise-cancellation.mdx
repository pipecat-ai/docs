title: "Krisp Noise Cancellation"
description: "Eliminate background noise and voices for more reliable agent interactions"

## Overview

Voice agents are vulnerable to background noise, especially other voices that trigger false interruptions. When this happens, your bot stops mid-sentence unnecessarily, creating a poor user experience. Pipecat Cloud's Krisp integration processes incoming audio to remove ambient noise and background voices before they reach your agent, resulting in cleaner audio input with fewer false interruptions and better transcription.

<Info>
  Krisp processes the audio before it reaches your agent's speech recognition
  and VAD systems, helping to ensure that only the intended user's voice
  triggers interruptions.

## Enabling Krisp

Enabling Krisp with Pipecat Cloud involves the following steps:

### 1. Use the Pipecat Base Image

Krisp dependencies are pre-installed in the official Pipecat base image. You don't need to add any Krisp-related packages to your `requirements.txt` file. Krisp support is available in the `dailyco/pipecat-base` image starting with version `0.0.6`.

```dockerfile
FROM dailyco/pipecat-base:latest

COPY ./requirements.txt requirements.txt

RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade -r requirements.txt

COPY ./bot.py bot.py
```

<Note>
  If you're not using the Pipecat base image and would like to use Krisp, please
  contact help@daily.co for assistance.
</Note>

### 2. Add the Krisp Filter to Your Transport

In your bot code, import and add the `KrispFilter` to your transport:

```python
from pipecat.audio.filters.krisp_filter import KrispFilter
from pipecat.audio.vad.silero import SileroVADAnalyzer
from pipecat.transports.services.daily import DailyParams, DailyTransport

transport = DailyTransport(
    room_url,
    token,
    "Voice AI Bot",
    DailyParams(
        audio_in_filter=KrispFilter(),  # Add Krisp filter here
        audioin_enabled=True,
        audio_out_enabled=True,
        vad_enabled=True,
        vad_analyzer=SileroVADAnalyzer(),
        vad_audio_passthrough=True,
    ),
)
```

### 3. Enable Krisp in Your Deployment

You can enable Krisp when deploying your agent through:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="CLI">
  
  ```bash
  pipecat cloud deploy --enable-krisp true
  ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Config File">
  
In your `pcc-deploy.toml`:
    
```toml
agent_name = "voice-starter"
image = "your-repo/voice-starter:0.1"
secret_set = "voice-starter-secrets"
enable_krisp = true

[scaling]
min_agents = 0

```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Dashboard">

  In the Pipecat Cloud dashboard:

  1. Navigate to your agent
  2. Go to Settings > Agent Configuration
  3. Toggle "Krisp Noise Cancellation" on
  4. Save your changes

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Check>
  Once configured, your agent will process incoming audio through Krisp's noise
  cancellation.
</Check>

## Testing Your Integration

To verify Krisp is working:

1. Deploy your agent with Krisp enabled
2. Connect to your agent in an environment with background noise; try turning on a TV or podcast
3. Observe whether background noises and voices affect your agent's behavior

## Pricing

Krisp processing is billed based on active session minutes:

| Usage Tier                      | Price              |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| First 100,000 minutes per month | Free               |
| Additional minutes              | $0.0002 per minute |

<Note>
  For agents deployed with Krisp enabled, active session minutes count as Krisp
  usage, accruing towards your monthly bill.
</Note>

## Local Development

Krisp cannot be used in local development environments, as it requires a proprietary SDK and model which can only be distributed on Pipecat Cloud. When running locally be sure to not import the KrispFilter module and don't apply it to your transport.

## Troubleshooting

If you're experiencing issues with Krisp noise cancellation:

- Verify `enable_krisp` is set to `true` in your deployment configuration
- Confirm you've added the `KrispFilter()` to your transport configuration
- Check your logs for any Krisp-related error messages
- Confirm that you have not added any Krisp-related dependencies to your `requirements.txt` file, as they are not needed and may cause conflicts.
```
