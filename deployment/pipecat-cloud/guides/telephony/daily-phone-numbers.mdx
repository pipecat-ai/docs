You can buy a phone number through the Pipecat Cloud Dashboard:

- Go to `Settings` > `Telephony` and follow the UI to purchase a phone number.

Or you can use the [REST API](https://docs.daily.co/reference/rest-api/phone-numbers) to find, buy, list, and release phone numbers.

### Search for available phone numbers

We offer several [search filters](https://docs.daily.co/reference/rest-api/phone-numbers/list-available-numbers), such as, `region`, `city`, `areacode`, etc that can help narrow down the search space for a phone number. The response contains phone numbers that meet the chosen criteria. For simplicty, in the below examples, we will use `+19499870006` as an example `phone_number`.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Request
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.daily.co/v1/list-available-numbers?region=CA' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer $DAILY_API_KEY'
```
```js Success
{
    "total_count": 1,
    "data": [{
        "number": "+19499800001",
        "region": "CA"
    }]
}
```
</CodeGroup>

### Buy a phone number

To purchase the chosen number, make a POST request to the [buy-phone-number](https://docs.daily.co/reference/rest-api/phone-numbers/buy-phone-number) and pass the chosen phone number in the data field. The response returns the phone number and a unique id. The unique id is needed when releasing the chosen phone number, for example.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Request
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://api.daily.co/v1/buy-phone-number' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer $DAILY_API_KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
        "number": "+19499800001"
}'
```
```js Success
{
    "id": "5ccc01ca-f448-4f17-b7b4-cf354b7b8256",
    "number": "+19499800001"
}
```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
  Use the id to select the desired phone number for dial-out. Pass it as
  `callerId` in the `start_dialout` API or include it in the `dialout_settings`
  JSON.
</Info>

### Release a phone number

To release a phone number associated with your account. Successfully deleting the number takes the phone number out of operation.

<Warning>
  For compliance reasons, a phone number cannot be released until 14 days after
  purchase. A successful release operation cannot be undone, and the phone
  number will be taken out of operation.
</Warning>

}
```
```js Failure

}
```
</CodeGroup>

### List all purchased phone numbers

You can also list all your purchased phone numbers using the following [API](https://docs.daily.co/reference/rest-api/phone-numbers/purchased-phone-numbers)

<CodeGroup>

    }]

</CodeGroup>

### CNAM Registration

Please contact `help@daily.co` for adding Caller Name (CNAM) to the purchased phone numbers. Daily will need your Name or Company Name to register with the United States CNAM Registry. Once registered, the Caller ID will display the appropriate name on the calling party's device.

We need the following information:

- All phone numbers and the corresponding CNAM entry. A CNAM entry can only be 14 letter long, including spaces.
- Company documents
- An employee's ID/driver's license

<Info>
  It can take up to 48 hours for the CNAM to reflect on the national caller ID
  name database and can take longer to update for major carriers, who check the
  national database periodically.
</Info>
