title: Daily PSTN Dial-out
description: "Using Daily’s Transport to make calls to external SIP Addresses and PSTN numbers"

To initiate outbound calls, you first need to configure your Daily rooms to allow dial-out by setting `enable_dialout` in `dailyRoomProperties`. Then, include the target phone number(s) in the request `body` of `{service}/start`.

In this example, we use the `dialout_settings` array to pass one or more phone numbers for the bot to dial. Each object in the array must include a `phoneNumber` and can optionally specify a `callerId` to control the outbound caller ID.

<Info>
  If no `callerId` is provided, a random phone number will be used to make the
  call. To specify the caller ID, use the [phone number's
  `id`](./daily-phone-numbers#list-all-purchased-phone-numbers) as the
  `callerId`.
</Info>

```bash
curl --request POST \
--url https://api.pipecat.daily.co/v1/public/{service}/start \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    'createDailyRoom': true,
    'dailyRoomProperties': {
        'enable_dialout': true,
        'exp': 1742353929
    },
    'body': {
        'dialout_settings': \
        [{'phoneNumber': '+1TARGET', 'callerId': 'UUID_OF_PURCHASED_NUM'}]
    }
}
```

<Info>
  The API_KEY here is Pipcat Cloud's [public API
  key](../../fundamentals/accounts-and-organizations#api-keys), typically begins
  with "pk_..."
</Info>

The bot should begin dialing out as soon as the call state transitions to the `joined` state.

Unlike dial-in scenarios where the bot typically speaks first, dial-out calls may require the bot to wait for the remote user to speak. In these cases, you can start listening for the remote user when the `on_dialout_answered` event fires.

This is also a good point to initiate voicemail detection—for example, by analyzing the remote user's audio to determine if the call has reached a voicemail.

```python
@transport.event_handler("on_call_state_updated")
async def on_call_state_updated(transport, state):
    if state == "joined" and dialout_settings:
        await start_dialout(transport, dialout_settings)

@transport.event_handler("on_dialout_answered")
    async def on_dialout_answered(transport, data):
        # the bot will wait for the user to speak before responding
        await rtvi.set_bot_ready()
```

### Examples of `dialout_settings`

Here are various configurations you can use in the `dialout_settings` array:

<CodeGroup>
```json Twilio SIP Address
"dialout_settings": [
  { 
    "sipUri": "sip:+1xxxx@domain.sip.twilio.com" 
  }
]
```

```json Phone Number with CallerID

"dialout_settings": [
  {
    "phoneNumber": "+1xxx",
    "callerId": "uuid"
  }
]

```

```json Multiple Phone Numbers
"dailout_settings": [
  {
    "phoneNumber": "+1xxx",
    "callerId": "uuid-1"
  },
  {
    "sipUri": "sip:+1xxxx@domain.sip.twilio.com"
  },
  {
    "phoneNumber": "+1xxx",
    "callerId": "uuid-1"
  }
]
```

</CodeGroup>

## Next Steps

After configuring your dial-out functionality, you can implement a Pipecat bot to handle the call interactions:
