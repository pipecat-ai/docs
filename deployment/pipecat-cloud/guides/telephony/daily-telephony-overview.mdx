title: Daily Telephony Overview
description: "Using Daily's PSTN and SIP infrastructure with your Pipecat Cloud agents"
---

DailyTransport supports both SIP and PSTN calls. This means that you can receive and make calls to and from external SIP addresses. Similarly for PSTN, you are able to purchase phone numbers and hence make and receive calls to and from the purchased phone numbers.

## Purchase a phone number

You can buy a phone number through the Pipecat Cloud Dashboard:

1. Go to `Settings` > `Telephony`
2. Follow the UI to purchase a phone number
3. Configure the webhook URL to receive incoming calls

Or purchase the number using Daily's [PhoneNumbers API](https://docs.daily.co/reference/rest-api/phone-numbers).

## Configure Pinless Dial-In

When a phone call or a SIP interconnect call is received on Daily, the call is placed on hold and the caller hears hold music while Daily triggers a webhook (`room_creation_api`). This phone number–to–webhook mapping is managed through your Daily domain. You can list, create, update, delete a `domain-dialin-config` entry using [Daily's REST API](https://docs.daily.co/reference/rest-api/domainDialinConfig). Below is an example for creating the dial-in config:

<CodeGroup>
```bash POST
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.daily.co/v1/domain-dialin-config \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer $DAILY_API_KEY' \

In the example, if you omit the `phone_number` field, Daily will generate a static SIP URI (`sip_uri`) that can be used for SIP interconnect. This is useful if you’re routing calls from providers like Twilio, Telnyx, Exotel, or Plivo.

## Dial-in

The call flow for handling inbound calls looks like this:

1. The user calls your purchased phone number. Daily receives the call and places it on hold.
2. A webhook triggers the `room_creation_api`.
3. Your server calls the Pipecat Cloud endpoint (`{service}/start`) with the `dialin_settings`.
4. The bot starts speaking as soon as the remote user joins.

In a future update, steps 2 and 3 will be automatically managed by Daily via a new `{service}/` endpoint, simplifying the process. While the update is being rolled out, we provide [example servers](https://github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat/tree/main/examples/deployment/pipecat-cloud-daily-pstn-server) built with `Next.js` and `FastAPI` to help you get started with your own implementation.

<Info>A call can be received on the `phone_number` or the `sip_uri`.</Info>

</Card>

## Dial-out

The call flow looks like this:

1. Your application calls the Pipecat Cloud endpoint with `dialout_settings`
2. Bot begins dialing out when the call state moves to `joined`
3. Bot waits for the remote party to speak before responding
