title: Starting Sessions
description: "Serving user requests with active sessions."
---

Once you have made a successful deployment, you can start on-demand sessions to begin interacting with your agent.

An active session is a running instance of your agent code that connects with you or your end-users.
Sessions are created in response to a request and scaled up or down based on your deployment configuration (see [Scaling](/agents/scaling)).

<Info>
  You must have an active billing account to start sessions. Usage is billed for
  the duration of each session, please refer to
  [pricing](https://www.daily.co/pricing/pipecat-cloud) for more information.
</Info>

Starting active sessions can be achieved programmatically via the REST API and Python library or directly via the CLI.

## Running an agent

Requests to start an agent requires passing a [public API key](/accounts-and-organizations#api-keys). Keys are used to ensure that only authorized users or apps can start sessions and can be cycled or revoked at any time.

### Development pattern

A typical application will start a session in response to a user request (via a web UI, mobile app, phone call or other client). Pipecat Cloud takes care of your session infrastructure and scaling, so you can focus on building your application logic.

Developers should:

1. Provide a secure endpoint to receive requests that keeps your API key secret

2. Pass any required data to the agent when starting a session (such as pipeline configuration, transport session data, etc.)

3. Handle any errors that may occur during the start process

### Using REST

The Pipecat Cloud REST API provides an endpoint to start a session with your agent over HTTP:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.pipecat.daily.co/v1/public/{agent_name}/start' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer PUBLIC_API_KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
    "createDailyRoom": true,
    "body": {"custom": "data"}
  }'
```

```python Python
endpoint = "https://api.pipecat.daily.co/v1/public/{service}/start"
agent_name = "my-first-agent"
api_key = "pk_..."

async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
    response = await session.post(
        f"{endpoint.format(service=agent_name)}",
        headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"},
        json={
            "createDailyRoom": True,  # Creates a Daily room
            "body": {"custom": "data"}  # Data to pass to your agent
        }
    )
```

</CodeGroup>

### Using Python

The Pipecat Python library provides helper methods to start a session with your agent:

```python
import asyncio

from pipecatcloud.exception import AgentStartError
from pipecatcloud.session import Session, SessionParams


async def main():
    try:
        # Create session object
        session = Session(
            agent_name="my-first-agent",
            api_key=API_KEY,  # Replace with your actual API key
            params=SessionParams(
                use_daily=True,  # Optional: Creates a Daily room
                daily_room_properties={"start_video_off": False},
                data={"key": "value"},
            ),
        )

        # Start the session
        response = await session.start()

        # Get Daily room URL
        daily_url = f"{response['dailyRoom']}?t={response['dailyToken']}"
        print(f"Join Daily room: {daily_url}")

    except AgentStartError as e:
        print(f"Error starting agent: {e}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Unexpected error: {e}")


# Run the async function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Using the CLI

To start an agent via the command line interface:

```shell
pcc agent start my-first-agent --api-key pk_...
```

You can select and use a default API key for the agent start command:

```shell
pcc organizations keys use my-default-key
```

See the [CLI reference](/cli-reference/agent#start) for more information.

## Passing data

Most agents will require some initial data, such pipeline configuration, transport session credentials, etc.

For sensitive data, we recommend using [secrets](/agents/secrets) to store and access your data securely.

You pass a data blob through to the start request (please note that the data must be JSON-serializable):

```bash
pcc agent start my-first-agent --data '{"room": "my-room"}'

# or from a file
pcc agent start my-first-agent --data-file data.json
```

Data passed to your session can be accessed in your agent code via the `bot()` method, which receives session arguments:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Standard Session">
  
    ```python
    # bot.py
    from pipecatcloud.agent import PipecatSessionArguments
    
    async def bot(args: PipecatSessionArguments):
        # Access the session ID
        logger.info(f"Session started with ID: {args.session_id}")
        
        # Access the custom data passed to the session
        logger.info(f"Session data: {args.body}")
        
        # ...
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Daily Voice Session">

    ```python
    # bot.py for voice agent
    from loguru import logger
    from pipecatcloud.agent import DailySessionArguments

    async def bot(args: DailySessionArguments):
        """Main bot entry point compatible with the FastAPI route handler.

        Args:
            room_url: The Daily room URL
            token: The Daily room token
            body: The configuration object from the request body
        """
        logger.info(f"Bot process initialized {args.room_url} {args.token}")
        logger.info(f"Custom data: {args.body}")
        logger.info(f"Session ID: {args.session_id}")

        try:
            await main(args.room_url, args.token)
            logger.info("Bot process completed")
        except Exception as e:
            logger.exception(f"Error in bot process: {str(e)}")
            raise
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="WebSocket Session">

    ```python
    # bot.py for WebSocket agent
    from loguru import logger
    from pipecatcloud.agent import WebSocketSessionArguments

    async def bot(args: WebSocketSessionArguments):
        """Main bot entry point for WebSocket connections.

        Args:
            ws: The WebSocket connection
        """
        logger.info("WebSocket bot process initialized")
        logger.info(f"Custom data: {args.body}")
        logger.info(f"Session ID: {args.session_id}")

        try:
            await main(args.websocket)
            logger.info("WebSocket bot process completed")
        except Exception as e:
            logger.exception(f"Error in WebSocket bot process: {str(e)}")
            raise
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

For more advanced data requirements, your application should run its own data fetching logic before a session request is made.

If you require your agent to fetch it's own data, be mindful of any blocking requests that could slow down the start process.

## Agent capacity

Deployments have an upper limit for the number of sessions that can be started concurrently.
This helps developers implement cost control and workload management and can be adjusted per deployment.

See [Scaling](/agents/scaling) for more information.

<Warning>
  While in beta, the default instance pool capacity is **50 active sessions per
  deployment**. Please contact us at help@daily.co or via
  [Discord](https://discord.gg/dailyco) if you require more capacity.
</Warning>

Developers are responsible for handling capacity errors when starting sessions. When your instance pool is at capacity, the start request will fail with a `429` status and code.

Here is a simple example of how to handle a capacity error:

<CodeGroup>

```bash REST
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.pipecat.daily.co/v1/public/{agent_name}/start' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer PUBLIC_API_KEY' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{}'

>> {
>>	"status": 429,
>>	"code": "429",
>>	"message": "Rate limit exceeded. Please try again later"
>> }
```

```python Python
from pipecatcloud import Session, SessionParams
from pipecatcloud.exception import AgentStartError

try:
    session = Session(
        agent_name="my-first-agent",
        api_key="pk_...",
        params=SessionParams(
            use_daily=False,
            data={}
        )
    )
except AgentStartError as e:
    # This will catch capacity errors and other start failures
    print(f"Error starting agent: {e}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
```

</CodeGroup>

## Logging and monitoring

Session observability can be accessed via the [Dashboard <Icon icon="arrow-up-right-from-square" iconType="solid" />](https://pipecat.daily.co) or from the CLI.

### Active sessions

To view active sessions via the CLI:

```shell
pcc agent sessions [my-first-agent]
```

This command will list all active sessions for the specified agent, alongside a session ID.

### Session logs

<Warning>Session logs are not available in beta.</Warning>

To view individual session logs, use the following command:

```shell
pcc agent logs [my-first-agent] --session [session-id]
```

For more information, see [Logging and Observability](/agents/logging).

## Stopping sessions

<Warning>Session termination is not available in beta.</Warning>

You can issue a termination request to stop an active session. This will immediately stop the instance so be aware of disrupting any ongoing user interactions.

```shell
pcc agent stop my-first-agent --session [session-id]
```

Deleting an agent deployment will block any new sessions from starting, but will not stop any active sessions. You must stop each session individually.

## Usage

You are charged for the duration of each session, see [pricing](https://www.daily.co/pricing/pipecat-cloud).

The exact duration of session is calculated based on:

- Time spent instantiating the agent
- Time spent running the agent
- Time spent tearing down the agent

You can monitor your usage on your [Dashboard <Icon icon="arrow-up-right-from-square" iconType="solid" />](https://pipecat.daily.co).
