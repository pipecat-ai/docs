## Configuring log level

You can control the Pipecat logging level for your deployed agents using the `PIPECAT_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable. This can be set as a [secret](/deployment/pipecat-cloud/fundamentals/secrets) or directly in your deployment configuration.

Available log levels:

| Level     | Description                                                          |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `TRACE`   | The most detailed information for debugging (includes Frame logging) |
| `DEBUG`   | Verbose output for debugging (default)                               |
| `INFO`    | General operational information                                      |
| `WARNING` | Warning messages for potential issues                                |
| `ERROR`   | Error messages only                                                  |

## Agent logs

Agent logs are available via both the CLI and Dashboard. You can view logs for a specific agent by running the following command:

```bash
pipecat cloud agent logs my-agent
```

This command accept various filters to help you narrow down the logs you are looking for. For example, you can filter logs by severity level:

```bash
pipecat cloud agent logs my-agent -l ERROR
```

### Session logging

We recommend using the `loguru` library for logging within your agent. This will ensure any logging within your agent associated to the session it is running in.

```python
from loguru import logger

async def bot():
	logger.info("Hello, world!") # will be associated with the session id
```

If you are handling logging manually, you can obtain the active session ID from the `PipecatRunnerArguments` object (or subclass alternative) passed to your `bot()` method:

```python
from pipecat.runner.types import PipecatRunnerArguments

async def bot(args: PipecatRunnerArguments):
	session_id = args.session_id
```

<Note>
  See [the Session Arguments reference](../sdk-reference/session-arguments) for
  more additional SessionArgument types.
