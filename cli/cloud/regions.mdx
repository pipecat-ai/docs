The `regions` command helps you discover which regions are available for deploying agents and storing secrets in Pipecat Cloud.

## list

List all available regions with their codes and display names.

**Usage:**

```shell
pipecat cloud regions list
```

This command displays a table of all regions where you can deploy agents and store secrets. Use the region codes shown in this list when specifying the `--region` flag in other commands.

**Example output:**

```
Code         Name
us-west      US West (Oregon)
us-east      US East (Virginia)
eu-central   Europe (Frankfurt)
ap-south     Asia Pacific (Mumbai)
```

## Using regions

Once you know the available region codes, you can use them with other commands:

**Deploy an agent to a specific region:**

```shell
pipecat cloud deploy my-agent my-image:latest --region eu-central
```

**Create secrets in a specific region:**

```shell
pipecat cloud secrets set my-secrets API_KEY=abc123 --region eu-central
```

**List agents in a specific region:**

```shell
pipecat cloud agent list --region us-east
```

<Info>
  Secrets and image pull secrets must be in the same region as the agents that
  use them. When deploying multi-region applications, create separate secret
  sets for each region.

<Tip>
  Choose a region close to your users for optimal latency and performance.
