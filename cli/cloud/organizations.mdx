The `organizations` command group helps you manage your Pipecat Cloud organizations and API keys. You can list and select organizations, as well as create, list, and manage API keys for use with the platform.

<Note>
  Organization and user management is not available via the CLI. Please use the
  [Pipecat Cloud Dashboard](https://pipecat.daily.co) to manage organizations
  and users.
</Note>

## list

Lists all organizations that your account has access to, highlighting the currently active one used for CLI operations.

**Usage:**

```shell
pipecat cloud organizations list
```

## select

Changes your active organization for CLI operations.

This command either presents an interactive selection menu or directly sets a specified organization as your default. The selection is stored in your local configuration file (defaults to `~/.config/pipecatcloud/pipecatcloud.toml`) and used for all subsequent CLI commands.

**Usage:**

```shell
pipecat cloud organizations select [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

<ParamField path="--organization / -o" type="string">
  Bypass prompt by directly specifying a namespace / organization string.
</ParamField>

## keys

The `keys` sub-commands manage API keys for authenticating with Pipecat Cloud services.

### keys list

Lists all API keys for the current organization.

**Usage:**

```shell
pipecat cloud organizations keys list [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

<ParamField path="--organization / -o" type="string">
  Organization ID to list keys for. If not provided, the default organization
  will be used.
</ParamField>

### keys create

Create a new public API key for account / organization. Command will prompt the user to enter
a human-readable name for the key.

```shell
pipecat cloud organizations keys create [OPTIONS]

### keys use

Sets a specific API key as your default for CLI operations.

The selected key is stored in the local configuration file (defaults to `~/.config/pipecatcloud/pipecatcloud.toml`) and will be used for all subsequent requests to the Pipecat Cloud API.

Please note that the key must be associated with the same user account or organization as you are making requests to.

If the public key is revoked or deleted via the dashboard, the user will need to re-run this command to select a new key.

```shell
pipecat cloud organizations keys use [OPTIONS]
```

<ParamField path="--organization / -o" type="string">
  Organization ID to select default key from. If not provided, the default
