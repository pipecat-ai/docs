## Introduction

You can dial-in to your Pipecat bots, and have them dial-out too, across both PSTN and SIP. The technical implementation will depend on your chosen transport and phone number vendor; each will likely have their own methods and events to consider.

## Key Terms

**PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network)**: The traditional phone network consisting of physical phone lines, cables, and transmission links. PSTN operates on a one-user-per-line basis.

**SIP (Session Initiation Protocol)**: A signaling protocol used for voice and video calls over IP networks. SIP can handle multiple users per line and enables advanced call control features like transfers, forwarding, and multi-party calls.

## Telephony Connection Options

### WebSocket Connections

**Best for:** Simple telephony workflows and quick prototypes

- **How it works:** Real-time audio streaming over WebSocket connections
- **Call control:** Basic, managed by the telephony provider
- **Supported providers:** Twilio, Telnyx, Plivo, Exotel
- **Limitations:** No advanced call center features like transfers or reconnects

**When to use:**

- Simple inbound/outbound calling
- Integration with existing Twilio Studio or Flex workflows
- Quick setup with minimal configuration

### WebRTC Connections

**Best for:** When connecting web clients to telephony systems or for more complex transfer scenarios

- **How it works:** Peer-to-peer real-time communication optimized for varying network conditions
- **Call control:** Advanced, includes track-level control
- **Supported providers:** Daily (with PSTN integration)
- **Benefits:** Designed for scale, handles network variations gracefully

**When to use:**

- When connecting web or mobile clients to telephony systems
- Applications requiring high-quality audio/video
- Users on devices with varying network conditions

### SIP Connections

**Best for:** Enterprise telephony and advanced call control scenarios

- **How it works:** Industry-standard protocol for voice/video calls over IP
- **Call control:** Full control, including transfers, forwarding, multi-party, etc.
- **Integration:** Works with legacy call centers and telephony systems
- **Vendor flexibility:** Supports multiple telephony vendors without platform-specific code

**When to use:**

- Multi-agent or multi-party calls
- Integration with legacy call centers
- Advanced features: warm transfers, agent assist, call forwarding
- Enterprise telephony requirements

<Note>
  **Multiple providers:** You can configure your Pipecat bots to handle multiple
  vendors simultaneously. For example, use both Daily and Twilio as phone number
  providers concurrently.
