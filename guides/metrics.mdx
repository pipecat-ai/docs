When developing real-time, multimodal AI applications, monitoring two key
factors is crucial: performance (latency) and LLM/TTS usage. Performance impacts
user experience, while usage can affect operational costs. Pipecat offers
built-in metrics for both, which can be enabled with straightforward
configuration options.

## Enabling performance metrics

Set `enable_metrics=True` in `PipelineParams` when creating a task:

```python Example config
task = PipelineTask(
            pipeline,
            PipelineParams(
                ...
                enable_metrics=True,
                ...
            ),
        )
```

Once enabled, Pipecat logs the following metrics:

| Metric          | Description                                     |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| TTFB            | Time To First Byte in seconds                   |
| Processing Time | Time taken by the service to respond in seconds |

```console Sample output
AnthropicLLMService#0 TTFB: 0.8378312587738037
CartesiaTTSService#0 processing time: 0.0005071163177490234
CartesiaTTSService#0 TTFB: 0.17177796363830566
AnthropicLLMService#0 processing time: 2.4927797317504883
```

### Limiting TTFB responses

If you only want the **first** TTFB measurement for each service, you can
optionally pass `report_only_initial_ttfb=True` in `PipelineParams`:

```python Example config
task = PipelineTask(
            pipeline,
            PipelineParams(
                ...
                enable_metrics=True,
                report_only_initial_ttfb=True,
                ...
            ),
        )
```

> **Note:** `enable_metrics=True` is required for this setting to have an
> effect.

# Enabling LLM/TTS Usage Metrics

Set `enable_usage_metrics=True` in PipelineParams when creating a task:

```python Example config
task = PipelineTask(
            pipeline,
            PipelineParams(
                ...
                enable_usage_metrics=True,
                ...
            ),
        )
```

Pipecat will log the following as applicable:

| Metric    | Description                                 |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| LLM Usage | Number of prompt and completion tokens used |
| TTS Usage | Number of characters processed              |

```console Sample output
CartesiaTTSService#0 usage characters: 65
AnthropicLLMService#0 prompt tokens: 104, completion tokens: 53
```

> **Note:** Usage metrics are recorded per interaction and do not represent
> running totals.
