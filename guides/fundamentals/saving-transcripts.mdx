## Overview

Recording transcripts of conversations between users and your bot is useful for debugging, analysis, and creating a record of interactions. Pipecat's `TranscriptProcessor` makes it easy to collect both user and bot messages as they occur.

## How It Works

The `TranscriptProcessor` collects transcripts by:

1. Capturing what the user says (from `TranscriptionFrame`s)
2. Capturing what the bot says (from `TTSTextFrame`s)
3. Emitting events with transcript updates in real-time
4. Allowing you to handle these events with custom logic

<Note>
  The `TranscriptProcessor` provides two separate processors: one for user
  speech and one for assistant speech. Both emit the same event type when new
  transcript content is available.
</Note>

## Basic Implementation

### Step 1: Create a Transcript Processor

First, initialize the transcript processor:

```python
from pipecat.processors.transcript_processor import TranscriptProcessor

# Create a single transcript processor instance
transcript = TranscriptProcessor()
```

### Step 2: Add to Your Pipeline

Place the processors in your pipeline at the appropriate positions:

```python
pipeline = Pipeline(
    [
        transport.input(),
        stt,                            # Speech-to-text
        transcript.user(),              # Captures user transcripts
        context_aggregator.user(),
        llm,
        tts,                            # Text-to-speech
        transport.output(),
        transcript.assistant(),         # Captures assistant transcripts
        context_aggregator.assistant(),
    ]
)
```

<Note>
  Place `transcript.user()` after the STT processor and `transcript.assistant()`
  after `transport.output()` to ensure accurate transcript collection.
</Note>

### Step 3: Handle Transcript Updates

Register an event handler to process transcript updates:

```python
@transcript.event_handler("on_transcript_update")
async def handle_transcript_update(processor, frame):
    # Each message contains role (user/assistant), content, and timestamp
    for message in frame.messages:
        print(f"[{message.timestamp}] {message.role}: {message.content}")
```

<Tip>
  In addition to console logging, you can save transcripts to a database or file
  for later analysis.

Consider implementing transcript recording in your application for debugging during development and preserving important conversations in production. The transcript data can also be useful for analyzing conversation patterns and improving your bot's responses over time.
