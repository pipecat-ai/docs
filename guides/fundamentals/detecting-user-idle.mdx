title: "Detecting Idle Users"
description: "Learn how to detect and respond when users are inactive in conversations"
---

## Overview

In conversational applications, it's important to handle situations where users go silent or inactive. Pipecat provides built-in idle detection through `LLMUserAggregator` and `UserTurnProcessor`, allowing your bot to respond appropriately when users haven't spoken for a defined period.

## How It Works

Idle detection monitors user activity and:

1. Starts tracking after the first interaction (user or bot speaking)
2. Resets a timer whenever the user or bot speaks
3. Pauses during function calls (which may take longer than the timeout)
4. Emits an `on_user_turn_idle` event when the user is idle for longer than the timeout period
5. Allows you to implement escalating responses or gracefully end the conversation in your application code

<Note>
  Idle detection uses continuous activity frames (`UserSpeakingFrame`,
  `BotSpeakingFrame`) to track real-time conversation activity. It requires an
  active speech-to-text service or a transport with built-in speech detection.
</Note>

## Basic Implementation

### Step 1: Enable Idle Detection

Enable idle detection by setting the `user_idle_timeout` parameter when creating your aggregator:

```python
from pipecat.processors.aggregators.llm_response_universal import (
    LLMContextAggregatorPair,
    LLMUserAggregatorParams,
)

user_aggregator, assistant_aggregator = LLMContextAggregatorPair(
    context,
    user_params=LLMUserAggregatorParams(
        user_idle_timeout=5.0,  # Detect idle after 5 seconds
    ),
)
```

### Step 2: Handle Idle Events

Create an event handler to respond when the user becomes idle:

```python
@user_aggregator.event_handler("on_user_turn_idle")
async def on_user_turn_idle(aggregator):
    # Send a reminder to the user
    message = {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "The user has been quiet. Politely ask if they're still there.",
    }
    await aggregator.push_frame(LLMMessagesAppendFrame([message], run_llm=True))
```

### Step 3: Implement Retry Logic (Optional)

For escalating responses, track retry count in your application:

```python
class IdleHandler:
    def __init__(self):
        self._retry_count = 0

    def reset(self):
        self._retry_count = 0

    async def handle_idle(self, aggregator):
        self._retry_count += 1

        if self._retry_count == 1:
            # First attempt - gentle reminder
            message = {
                "role": "system",
                "content": "The user has been quiet. Politely ask if they're still there.",
            }
            await aggregator.push_frame(LLMMessagesAppendFrame([message], run_llm=True))
        elif self._retry_count == 2:
            # Second attempt - more direct
            message = {
                "role": "system",
                "content": "The user is still inactive. Ask if they'd like to continue.",
            }
            await aggregator.push_frame(LLMMessagesAppendFrame([message], run_llm=True))
        else:
            # Third attempt - end conversation
            await aggregator.push_frame(
                TTSSpeakFrame("It seems like you're busy. Have a nice day!")
            )
            await aggregator.push_frame(EndTaskFrame(), FrameDirection.UPSTREAM)

# Use the handler
idle_handler = IdleHandler()

@user_aggregator.event_handler("on_user_turn_idle")
async def on_user_turn_idle(aggregator):
    await idle_handler.handle_idle(aggregator)

@user_aggregator.event_handler("on_user_turn_started")
async def on_user_turn_started(aggregator, strategy):
    idle_handler.reset()  # Reset retry count when user speaks
```

## Best Practices

- **Set appropriate timeouts**: Shorter timeouts (5-10 seconds) work well for voice conversations
- **Use escalating responses**: Start with gentle reminders and gradually become more direct
- **Limit retry attempts**: After 2-3 unsuccessful attempts, consider [ending the conversation](/guides/learn/pipeline-termination) gracefully by pushing an `EndTaskFrame`
- **Reset on user activity**: Use the `on_user_turn_started` event to reset your retry counter when the user speaks
- **Let the LLM respond naturally**: Use system messages to prompt the LLM rather than hardcoded TTS responses for more natural interactions

Implementing idle user detection improves the conversational experience by ensuring your bot can handle periods of user inactivity gracefully, either by prompting for re-engagement or politely ending the conversation when appropriate.
