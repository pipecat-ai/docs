  Check out our [Gemini Live demo](https://github.com/pipecat-ai/gemini-live-web-starter) showing how to build with a web client using vision capabilities.
</Tip>

Gemini Live is Google's speech-to-speech API that enables natural, real-time voice conversations with AI. With Pipecat, you can build production-ready voice agents that leverage Gemini Live for telephony, web, and mobile applications.

### Architecture

Pipecat manages connections between your client and Gemini Live:

<Frame>![Gemini Live Architecture](/images/gemini-live-architecture.png)</Frame>

The Pipecat server handles media streaming with clients via WebRTC (web/mobile) or WebSockets (telephony), while maintaining a persistent connection to Gemini Live for real-time AI processing.

## Quick Start

The fastest way to start building is with the Pipecat CLI:

```bash
# Install the CLI
uv tool install pipecat-ai-cli

# Create a new project
pipecat init
```

The CLI will guide you through selecting:
- **Bot type**: Gemini Live (speech-to-speech)
- **Transport**: Daily WebRTC, Twilio, or others
- **Deployment target**: Local development or Pipecat Cloud

<Tip>
All CLI commands can use either `pipecat` or the shorter `pc` alias.

## Starter Projects

These complete examples demonstrate Gemini Live in production scenarios. Each includes local development setup and Pipecat Cloud deployment configuration.

### Phone Bot (Twilio)

A telephone-based voice agent using Gemini Live with Twilio WebSockets. The demo plays "Two Truths and a Lie" to showcase natural conversation flow.

**Try it now**: Call **1-970-LIVE-API** (1-970-548-3274) to talk to a live demo.

**What you'll learn**:
- Twilio WebSocket transport configuration
- Google STT/TTS integration alongside Gemini Live
- TwiML setup for incoming calls
- Pipecat Cloud deployment with telephony

### Web Bot (Vision)

A browser-based agent with screensharing and vision capabilities, built with the Pipecat Voice UI Kit and Daily WebRTC transport.

</Card>

**What you'll learn**:
- Daily WebRTC transport for web clients
- Vision/screenshare processing with Gemini Live
- Next.js client with Voice UI Kit components
- Resizable panels and event logging

## Deployment

Both starter projects include configuration for [Pipecat Cloud](/deployment/pipecat-cloud/introduction), which handles scaling, monitoring, and global deployment.

```bash
# Authenticate with Pipecat Cloud
pipecat cloud auth login

# Build and push your Docker image
pipecat cloud docker build-push

# Deploy your agent
pipecat cloud deploy
```

Each starter includes a `pcc-deploy.toml` file with sensible defaults for agent configuration and scaling.
