Pipecat Flows provides a framework for building structured conversations in your AI applications. It enables you to create both predefined conversation paths and dynamically generated flows while handling the complexities of state management and LLM interactions.

The framework consists of:

- A Python module for building conversation flows with Pipecat
- A visual editor for designing and exporting flow configurations

## Key Concepts

- **Nodes**: Represent conversation states with specific messages and available functions
- **Messages**: Set the role and tasks for each node
- **Functions**: Define actions and transitions (Node functions for operations, Edge functions for transitions)
- **Actions**: Execute operations during state transitions (pre/post actions)
- **State Management**: Handle conversation state and data persistence

## When to Use Static vs Dynamic Flows

**Static Flows** are ideal when:

- Conversation structure is known upfront
- Paths follow predefined patterns
- Flow can be fully configured in advance
- Example: Customer service scripts, intake forms

**Dynamic Flows** are better when:

- Paths depend on external data
- Flow structure needs runtime modification
- Complex decision trees are involved
- Example: Personalized recommendations, adaptive workflows

# Core Concepts

## Designing Conversation Flows

Functions in Pipecat Flows serve two key purposes:

- interfacing with external systems and APIs through LLM function calls
- advancing the conversation to the next node

### Function Handlers

When you need to collect data, validate input, or retrieve information, add a handler to your function. These handlers are async functions that execute when the LLM calls the function, allowing you to interact with databases, APIs, or other external services:

```python
# Example function handler
async def check_availability(args: FlowArgs) -> FlowResult:
    """Check restaurant availability for the requested time."""
    date = args["date"]
    time = args["time"]
    party_size = args["party_size"]

    # Interface with reservation system
    available = await reservation_system.check_availability(date, time, party_size)
    return {"status": "success", "available": available}
```

### Transitioning Between Nodes

To advance the conversation, Pipecat Flows offers two approaches based on your flow type:

For static flows, use the `transition_to` property to specify the next node:

```python
{
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
        "name": "confirm_reservation",
        "handler": save_reservation,  # Process the reservation
        "parameters": {...},
        "transition_to": "send_confirmation"  # Move to confirmation node
    }
}
```

For dynamic flows, use a transition callback to determine the next node at runtime:

```python
{
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
        "name": "confirm_reservation",
        "handler": save_reservation,  # Process the reservation
        "parameters": {...},
        "transition_callback": send_confirmation  # Call the corresponding handler to set_node()
    }
}
```

### Transition Callbacks (Dynamic Flows)

Transition callbacks receive both the original function arguments and the typed result:

```python
async def handle_confirmation(
    args: Dict,           # Original function arguments
    result: FlowResult,   # Typed result from handler
    flow_manager: FlowManager
):
    """Handle transition based on function result."""
    if result["success"]:
        await flow_manager.set_node("send_confirmation", create_confirmation_node())
    else:
        await flow_manager.set_node(
            "retry_reservation",
            create_retry_node(result.error_message)
        )
```

For backwards compatibility, callbacks can also use the two-argument signature:

```python
async def handle_confirmation(args: Dict, flow_manager: FlowManager):
    """Legacy transition handler."""
    await flow_manager.set_node("next", create_next_node())
```

You can combine both approaches: use handlers to process data and transitions to advance the conversation, creating flows that are both functional and conversational.

## Node Structure

Each node in your flow represents a conversation state and consists of three main components:

### Messages

Nodes use two types of messages to control the conversation:

1. **Role Messages**: Define the bot's personality or role (optional)

```python
"role_messages": [
    {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "You are a friendly pizza ordering assistant. Keep responses casual and upbeat."
    }
]
```

2. **Task Messages**: Define what the bot should do in the current node

```python
"task_messages": [
    {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "Ask the customer which pizza size they'd like: small, medium, or large."
    }
]
```

Role messages are typically defined in your initial node and inherited by subsequent nodes, while task messages are specific to each node's purpose.

### Functions

Functions in Pipecat Flows can:

1. Process data (using `handler`)
2. Create transitions (using `transition_to` for static or `transition_callback` for dynamic flows)
3. Provide immediate feedback before execution (using `start_callback`)
4. Do any combination of the above

This leads to two conceptual types of functions:

- Node functions, which execute a handler within a state
- Edge function, which create transitions between nodes and optionally executes a handler

<Note>
  Function type is defined implicitly based on the existence (or absence) of the
  transition properties
</Note>

#### Node Functions

Functions that process data within a state. They typically:

- Have a `handler` to interface with external systems or APIs
- May have a `start_callback` to provide immediate feedback
- Trigger an immediate LLM completion with the result

```python
from pipecat_flows import FlowArgs, FlowResult

async def select_size(args: FlowArgs) -> FlowResult:
    """Process pizza size selection."""
    size = args["size"]
    return {
        "status": "success",
        "size": size
    }

# Node function configuration
{
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
        "name": "select_size",
        "handler": select_size,           # Required: Processes the selection
        "start_callback": before_select_size,  # Optional: Provides immediate feedback
        "description": "Select pizza size",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "size": {"type": "string", "enum": ["small", "medium", "large"]}
            }
        },
    }
}
```

#### Edge Functions

Functions that create transitions between nodes. When called, they:

- Execute their `handler` (if one is provided)
- May execute a `start_callback` before processing begins
- Add function results to context
- Must have `transition_to` (static flow) or `transition_callback` (dynamic flow) to specify the next state
- Trigger LLM completion after both the function result and new node's messages are in context

```python
# Edge function configuration
{
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
        "name": "next_step",
        "description": "Move to next state",
        "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {}},
        "handler": select_size,        # Optional: Process data during transition
        "start_callback": before_api_call,  # Optional: Provide feedback before execution
        "transition_to": "target_node" # Required: Specify next state
    }
}
```

#### Start Callbacks

Start callbacks execute before a function is called, allowing you to:

- Provide immediate feedback while long-running operations complete
- Acknowledge user requests before processing
- Add wait messages for API calls or database operations

```python
# Define a start callback
async def before_check_weather(function_name: str, llm: Any, context: Any) -> None:
    """Tell the user we're checking the weather."""
    await llm.push_frame(TTSSpeakFrame("Let me check the weather for you..."))

# Use in function configuration
{
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
        "name": "check_weather",
        "handler": check_weather_handler,
        "start_callback": before_check_weather,  # Add start callback
        "description": "Get weather information",
        "parameters": {...}
    }
}
```

A function's behavior is determined by its properties:

- `handler` only: Process data, stay in current state
- `transition_to` (static flow) or `transition_callback` (dynamic flow) only: Pure transition to next state
- `start_callback` only or combined with others: Provide immediate feedback before execution
- Multiple properties: Combine behaviors (e.g., feedback â†’ process data â†’ transition)

### Actions

Actions are operations that execute during state transitions, with two distinct timing options:

- Pre-actions: execute before the LLM completion
- Post-actions: execute after the LLM completion

#### Pre-Actions

Execute before LLM inference. Useful for:

- Providing immediate feedback while waiting for LLM responses
- Bridging gaps during longer function calls
- Setting up state or context

```python
"pre_actions": [
    {
        "type": "tts_say",
        "text": "Hold on a moment..."  # Immediate feedback during processing
    }
],
```

<Tip>
  Avoid mixing `tts_say` actions with chat completions as this may result in a
  conversation flow that feels unnatural. `tts_say` are best used as filler
  words when the LLM will take time to generate an completion.
</Tip>

#### Post-Actions

Execute after LLM inference completes. Useful for:

- Cleanup operations
- State finalization
- Ensuring proper sequence of operations

```python
"post_actions": [
    {
        "type": "end_conversation"  # Ensures TTS completes before ending
    }
]
```

#### Timing Considerations

- **Pre-actions**: Execute immediately, before any LLM processing begins
- **LLM Inference**: Processes the node's messages and functions
- **Post-actions**: Execute only after LLM processing and TTS completion

For example, when using `end_conversation` as a post-action, the sequence is:

1. LLM generates response
2. TTS speaks the response
3. End conversation action executes

This ordering ensures proper completion of all operations.

#### Action Types

Flows comes equipped with built-in actions and you can define your own custom actions. See the [reference docs](/server/utilities/flows/pipecat-flows#built-in-actions) for more information.

## Context Management

Pipecat Flows provides three strategies for managing conversation context during node transitions:

### Context Strategies

- **APPEND** (default): Adds new messages to the existing context, maintaining the full conversation history
- **RESET**: Clears the context and starts fresh with the new node's messages
- **RESET_WITH_SUMMARY**: Resets the context but includes an AI-generated summary of the previous conversation

### Configuration

Context strategies can be configured globally or per-node:

```python
from pipecat_flows import ContextStrategy, ContextStrategyConfig

# Global strategy configuration
flow_manager = FlowManager(
    task=task,
    llm=llm,
    context_aggregator=context_aggregator,
    context_strategy=ContextStrategyConfig(
        strategy=ContextStrategy.RESET_WITH_SUMMARY,
        summary_prompt="Summarize the key points discussed so far, focusing on decisions made and important information collected."
    )
)

# Per-node strategy configuration
node_config = {
    "task_messages": [...],
    "functions": [...],
    "context_strategy": ContextStrategyConfig(
        strategy=ContextStrategy.RESET_WITH_SUMMARY,
        summary_prompt="Provide a concise summary of the customer's order details and preferences."
    )
}
```

### Strategy Selection

Choose your strategy based on your conversation needs:

- Use **APPEND** when full conversation history is important
- Use **RESET** when previous context might confuse the current node's purpose
- Use **RESET_WITH_SUMMARY** for long conversations where key points need to be preserved

<Note>
  When using RESET_WITH_SUMMARY, if summary generation fails or times out, the
  system automatically falls back to RESET strategy for resilience.
</Note>

## State Management

The `state` variable in FlowManager is a shared dictionary that persists throughout the conversation. Think of it as a conversation memory that lets you:

- Store user information
- Track conversation progress
- Share data between nodes
- Inform decision-making

Here's a practical example of a pizza ordering flow:

```python
# Store user choices as they're made
async def select_size(args: FlowArgs) -> FlowResult:
    """Handle pizza size selection."""
    size = args["size"]

    # Initialize order in state if it doesn't exist
    if "order" not in flow_manager.state:
        flow_manager.state["order"] = {}

    # Store the selection
    flow_manager.state["order"]["size"] = size

    return {"status": "success", "size": size}

async def select_toppings(args: FlowArgs) -> FlowResult:
    """Handle topping selection."""
    topping = args["topping"]

    # Get existing order and toppings
    order = flow_manager.state.get("order", {})
    toppings = order.get("toppings", [])

    # Add new topping
    toppings.append(topping)
    order["toppings"] = toppings
    flow_manager.state["order"] = order

    return {"status": "success", "toppings": toppings}

async def finalize_order(args: FlowArgs) -> FlowResult:
    """Process the complete order."""
    order = flow_manager.state.get("order", {})

    # Validate order has required information
    if "size" not in order:
        return {"status": "error", "error": "No size selected"}

    # Calculate price based on stored selections
    size = order["size"]
    toppings = order.get("toppings", [])
    price = calculate_price(size, len(toppings))

    return {
        "status": "success",
        "summary": f"Ordered: {size} pizza with {', '.join(toppings)}",
        "price": price
    }
```

In this example:

1. `select_size` initializes the order and stores the size
2. `select_toppings` builds a list of toppings
3. `finalize_order` uses the stored information to process the complete order

The state variable makes it easy to:

- Build up information across multiple interactions
- Access previous choices when needed
- Validate the complete order
- Calculate final results

This is particularly useful when information needs to be collected across multiple conversation turns or when later decisions depend on earlier choices.

## LLM Provider Support

Pipecat Flows automatically handles format differences between LLM providers:

### OpenAI Format

```python
"functions": [{
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
        "name": "function_name",
        "handler": select_size, # Optional handler
        "description": "description",
        "parameters": {...},
        "transition_to": "target_node" # Optional transition (or transition_callback for dynamic flows)
    }
}]
```

### Anthropic Format

```python
"functions": [{
    "name": "function_name",
    "handler": select_size, # Optional handler
    "description": "description",
    "input_schema": {...},
    "transition_to": "target_node" # Optional transition (or transition_callback for dynamic flows)
}]
```

### Google (Gemini) Format

```python
"functions": [{
    "function_declarations": [{
        "name": "function_name",
        "handler": select_size, # Optional handler
        "description": "description",
        "parameters": {...},
        "transition_to": "target_node" # Optional transition (or transition_callback for dynamic flows)
    }]
}]
```

<Note>
  You don't need to handle these differences manually - Pipecat Flows adapts
  your configuration to the correct format based on your LLM provider.
</Note>
# Implementation Approaches

## Static Flows

Static flows use a configuration-driven approach where the entire conversation structure is defined upfront.

### Basic Setup

```python
from pipecat_flows import FlowManager

# Define flow configuration
flow_config = {
    "initial_node": "greeting",
    "nodes": {
        "greeting": {
            "role_messages": [...],
            "task_messages": [...],
            "functions": [...]
        }
    }
}

# Initialize flow manager with static configuration
flow_manager = FlowManager(
    task=task,
    llm=llm,
    context_aggregator=context_aggregator,
    flow_config=flow_config
)

@transport.event_handler("on_first_participant_joined")
async def on_first_participant_joined(transport, participant):
    await transport.capture_participant_transcription(participant["id"])
    await flow_manager.initialize()
```

### Example FlowConfig

```python
flow_config = {
    "initial_node": "start",
    "nodes": {
        "start": {
            "role_messages": [
                {
                    "role": "system",
                    "content": "You are an order-taking assistant. You must ALWAYS use the available functions to progress the conversation. This is a phone conversation and your responses will be converted to audio. Keep the conversation friendly, casual, and polite. Avoid outputting special characters and emojis.",
                }
            ],
            "task_messages": [
                {
                    "role": "system",
                    "content": "You are an order-taking assistant. Ask if they want pizza or sushi."
                }
            ],
            "functions": [
                {
                    "type": "function",
                    "function": {
                        "name": "choose_pizza",
                        "description": "User wants pizza",
                        "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {}},
                        "transition_to": "pizza_order"  # Specify transition
                    }
                },
                {
                    "type": "function",
                    "function": {
                        "name": "select_size",
                        "handler": select_size,
                        "description": "Select pizza size",
                        "parameters": {
                            "type": "object",
                            "properties": {
                                "size": {"type": "string", "enum": ["small", "medium", "large"]}
                            }
                        },
                        "transition_to": "toppings"  # Optional transition after processing
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

### Transition Best Practices

- Use `transition_to` to make state changes explicit
- Combine handlers with transitions when appropriate
- Keep transitions focused on single responsibilities

## Dynamic Flows

Dynamic flows create and modify conversation paths at runtime based on data or business logic.

### Example Implementation

Here's a complete example of a dynamic insurance quote flow:

```python
from pipecat_flows import FlowManager, FlowArgs, FlowResult

# Define handlers and transitions
async def collect_age(args: FlowArgs) -> AgeResult:
    """Process age collection."""
    age = args["age"]
    return AgeResult(status="success", age=age)

async def handle_age_transition(
    args: Dict,
    result: AgeResult,  # Typed result from handler
    flow_manager: FlowManager
):
    """Transition handler that determines next node based on age."""
    # Use typed result directly
    if result.age < 25:
        await flow_manager.set_node("young_adult", create_young_adult_node())
    else:
        await flow_manager.set_node("standard", create_standard_node())

# Node creation functions
def create_initial_node() -> NodeConfig:
    """Create initial age collection node."""
    return {
        "role_messages": [
            {
                "role": "system",
                "content": "You are an insurance quote assistant."
            }
        ],
        "task_messages": [
            {
                "role": "system",
                "content": "Ask for the customer's age."
            }
        ],
        "functions": [
            {
                "type": "function",
                "function": {
                    "name": "collect_age",
                    "handler": collect_age,
                    "description": "Collect customer age",
                    "parameters": {
                        "type": "object",
                        "properties": {
                            "age": {"type": "integer"}
                        }
                    },
                    "transition_callback": handle_age_transition
                }
            }
        ]
    }

def create_young_adult_node() -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Create node for young adult quotes."""
    return {
        "task_messages": [
            {
                "role": "system",
                "content": "Explain our special young adult coverage options."
            }
        ],
        "functions": [...]  # Additional quote-specific functions
    }

def create_standard_node() -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Create node for standard quotes."""
    return {
        "task_messages": [
            {
                "role": "system",
                "content": "Present our standard coverage options."
            }
        ],
        "functions": [...]  # Additional quote-specific functions
    }

# Initialize flow manager
flow_manager = FlowManager(
    task=task,
    llm=llm,
    context_aggregator=context_aggregator,
)

@transport.event_handler("on_first_participant_joined")
async def on_first_participant_joined(transport, participant):
    await transport.capture_participant_transcription(participant["id"])
    await flow_manager.initialize()
    await flow_manager.set_node("initial", create_initial_node())
```

### Best Practices

- Keep data processing in handlers and flow logic in transition callbacks
- Store shared data in flow_manager.state
- Create separate functions for node creation

The Pipecat Flow Editor provides a visual interface for creating and managing conversation flows. It offers a node-based interface that makes it easier to design, visualize, and modify your flows.

## Visual Design

### Node Types

- **Start Node** (Green): Entry point of your flow

  ```python
  "greeting": {
      "role_messages": [...],
      "task_messages": [...],
      "functions": [...]
  }
  ```

- **Flow Nodes** (Blue): Intermediate states

  ```python
  "collect_info": {
      "task_messages": [...],
      "functions": [...],
      "pre_actions": [...]
  }
  ```

- **End Node** (Red): Final state

  ```python
  "end": {
      "task_messages": [...],
      "functions": [],
      "post_actions": [{"type": "end_conversation"}]
  }
  ```

- **Function Nodes**:
  - Edge Functions (Purple): Create transitions
    ```python
    {
        "name": "next_node",
        "description": "Transition to next state"
    }
    ```
  - Node Functions (Orange): Perform operations
    ```python
    {
        "name": "process_data",
        "handler": process_data_handler,
        "description": "Process user data"
    }
    ```

## Naming Conventions

- **Start Node**: Use descriptive names (e.g., "greeting", "welcome")
- **Flow Nodes**: Name based on purpose (e.g., "collect_info", "verify_data")
- **End Node**: Conventionally named "end"
- **Functions**: Use clear, action-oriented names

### Function Configuration

```python
# Edge Function (Transition)
{
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
        "name": "next_state",
        "description": "Clear transition description",
        "parameters": {...}
        "transition_to": "target_node_name" # Transition target
    }
}

# Node Function (Operation)
{
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
        "name": "process_data",
        "handler": process_handler,  # Include handler
        "description": "Clear operation description",
        "parameters": {...}
    }
}
```

When using the Flow Editor, function handlers can be specified using the `__function__:` token:

```python
{
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
        "name": "process_data",
        "handler": "__function__:process_data",  # References function in main script
        "description": "Process user data",
        "parameters": {...}
    }
}
```

The handler will be looked up in your main script when the flow is executed.

<Note>
  When function handlers are specified in the flow editor, they will be exported
  with the `__function__:` token.
</Note>

## Using the Editor

### Creating a New Flow

1. Start with a descriptively named Start Node
2. Add Flow Nodes for each conversation state
3. Connect nodes using Edge Functions
4. Add Node Functions for operations
5. Include an End Node

### Import/Export

```python
# Export format
{
    "initial_node": "greeting",
    "nodes": {
        "greeting": {
            "role_messages": [...],
            "task_messages": [...],
            "functions": [...],
            "pre_actions": [...]
        },
        "process": {
            "task_messages": [...],
            "functions": [...],
        },
        "end": {
            "task_messages": [...],
            "functions": [],
            "post_actions": [...]
        }
    }
}
```

### Tips

- Use the visual preview to verify flow logic
- Test exported configurations
- Document node purposes and transitions
- Keep flows modular and maintainable
