## What is Context in Pipecat?

In Pipecat, **context** refers to the conversation history that the LLM uses to generate responses. The context consists of a list of alternating user/assistant messages that represents the collective history of the entire conversation.

```python
# Example context structure
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi there! How can I help you?"},
    # Context aggregators automatically add new messages here
]
```

Since Pipecat is a real-time voice AI framework, context management happens automatically as the conversation flows, but you can also control it manually when needed.

## How Context Updates During Conversations

Context updates happen automatically as frames flow through your pipeline:

**User Messages:**

1. User speaks → `InputAudioRawFrame` → STT Service → `TranscriptionFrame`
2. `context_aggregator.user()` receives `TranscriptionFrame` and adds user message to context

**Assistant Messages:**

1. LLM generates response → `LLMTextFrame` → TTS Service → `TTSTextFrame`
2. `context_aggregator.assistant()` receives `TTSTextFrame` and adds assistant message to context

**Frame types that update context:**

- **`TranscriptionFrame`**: Contains user speech converted to text by STT service
- **`LLMTextFrame`**: Contains LLM-generated responses
- **`TTSTextFrame`**: Contains bot responses converted to text by TTS service (represents what was actually spoken)

<Note>
  The TTS service processes `LLMTextFrame`s but outputs `TTSTextFrame`s, which
  represent the actual spoken text returned by the TTS provider. This ensures
  context matches what users actually hear.
</Note>

## Setting Up Context Management

Pipecat includes a context aggregator that creates and manages context for both user and assistant messages:

### 1. Create the Context and Context Aggregator

```python
# Create LLM service
llm = OpenAILLMService(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))

# Create context with initial messages
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful voice assistant."}
]

# Create context (messages only)
context = OpenAILLMContext(messages)

# Create context aggregator instance
context_aggregator = llm.create_context_aggregator(context)
```

### 2. Context with Function Calling

Context can also include tools (function definitions) that the LLM can call during conversations:

```python
from pipecat.adapters.schemas.function_schema import FunctionSchema
from pipecat.adapters.schemas.tools_schema import ToolsSchema

# Define available functions
weather_function = FunctionSchema(
    name="get_current_weather",
    description="Get the current weather",
    properties={
        "location": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA",
        },
        "format": {
            "type": "string",
            "enum": ["celsius", "fahrenheit"],
            "description": "The temperature unit to use.",
        },
    },
    required=["location", "format"],
)

# Create tools schema
tools = ToolsSchema(standard_tools=[weather_function])

# Create context with both messages and tools
context = OpenAILLMContext(messages, tools)
context_aggregator = llm.create_context_aggregator(context)
```

Function call results are also automatically stored in the context, maintaining a complete conversation history including tool interactions.

<Note>
  We'll cover function calling in detail in an upcoming section. The context
  aggregator handles function call storage automatically.
</Note>

### 3. Add Context Aggregators to Your Pipeline

```python
pipeline = Pipeline([
    transport.input(),
    stt,
    context_aggregator.user(),      # User context aggregator
    llm,
    tts,
    transport.output(),
    context_aggregator.assistant(), # Assistant context aggregator
])
```

## Context Aggregator Placement

The placement of context aggregator instances in your pipeline is **crucial** for proper operation:

### User Context Aggregator

Place the user context aggregator **downstream from the STT service**. Since the user's speech results in `TranscriptionFrame` objects pushed by the STT service, the user aggregator needs to be positioned to collect these frames.

### Assistant Context Aggregator

Place the assistant context aggregator **after `transport.output()`**. This positioning is important because:

- The TTS service outputs `TTSTextFrame`s in addition to audio
- The assistant aggregator must be downstream to collect those frames
- It ensures context updates happen word-by-word for specific services (e.g. Cartesia, ElevenLabs, and Rime)
- Your context stays updated at the word level in case an interruption occurs

<Tip>
  Always place the assistant context aggregator **after** `transport.output()`
  to ensure proper word-level context updates during interruptions.
</Tip>

## Manual Context Control

You can programmatically add new messages to the context by pushing or queueing specific frames:

### Adding Messages

- **`LLMMessagesAppendFrame`**: Appends a new message to the existing context
- **`LLMMessagesUpdateFrame`**: Completely replaces the existing context with new messages

```python
# Add a new system message to context
new_message = {"role": "system", "content": "You are now in expert mode."}
await task.queue_frames([
    LLMMessagesAppendFrame([new_message]),
    context_aggregator.user().get_context_frame()  # Trigger bot response
])
```

### Retrieving Current Context

The context aggregator provides a `get_context_frame()` method to obtain the latest context:

```python
await task.queue_frames([context_aggregator.user().get_context_frame()])
```

## Triggering Bot Responses

You'll commonly use this manual mechanism—obtaining the current context and pushing/queueing it—to trigger the bot to speak in two scenarios:

1. **Starting a pipeline** where the bot should speak first
2. **After pushing new context frames** using `LLMMessagesAppendFrame` or `LLMMessagesUpdateFrame`

```python
# Example: Bot speaks first when pipeline starts
@transport.event_handler("on_client_connected")
async def on_client_connected(transport, client):
    # Add greeting instruction and trigger response
    messages.append({"role": "system", "content": "Greet the user warmly."})
    await task.queue_frames([context_aggregator.user().get_context_frame()])
```

This gives you fine-grained control over when and how the bot responds during the conversation flow.

## Key Takeaways

- **Context is conversation history** - automatically maintained as users and bots exchange messages
- **Frame types matter** - `TranscriptionFrame` for users, `TTSTextFrame` for assistants
- **Placement matters** - user aggregator after STT, assistant aggregator after transport output
- **Tools are included** - function definitions and results are stored in context
- **Manual control available** - use frames to append messages or trigger responses when needed
- **Word-level precision** - proper placement ensures context accuracy during interruptions

Now that you understand context management, let's explore how to configure the LLM services that process this context to generate intelligent responses.
