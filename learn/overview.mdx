## What You'll Learn

This comprehensive guide will teach you how to build real-time voice AI agents with Pipecat. By the end, you'll be equipped with the knowledge to create custom applications—from simple voice assistants to complex multimodal bots that can see, hear, and speak.

  **Prerequisites**: Basic Python knowledge is recommended. The guide takes
  approximately 45-60 minutes to complete, with hands-on examples throughout.

## Why Voice AI is Challenging

Building responsive voice AI applications involves coordinating multiple AI services in real-time:

- **Speech recognition** must transcribe audio as users speak
- **Language models** need to process context and generate responses
- **Speech synthesis** has to convert text back to natural audio
- **Network transports** must handle streaming audio with minimal delay

Doing this manually means managing complex timing, buffering, error handling, and service coordination. Most developers end up rebuilding the same orchestration logic repeatedly.

## Pipecat's Solution

Pipecat solves this orchestration problem with a **pipeline architecture** that handles the complexity for you. Instead of managing individual API calls and timing, you define a flow of processing steps that work together automatically.

Here's what makes Pipecat different:

## Core Architecture Concepts

Before diving into how voice AI works, let's understand Pipecat's three foundational concepts:

### Frames

Think of frames as **data packages** moving through your application. Each frame contains a specific type of information:

- Audio data from a microphone
- Transcribed text from speech recognition
- Generated responses from an LLM
- Synthesized audio for playback

### Frame Processors

Frame processors are **specialized workers** that handle specific tasks:

- A speech-to-text processor converts audio frames into text frames
- An LLM processor takes text frames and produces response frames
- A text-to-speech processor converts response frames into audio frames

### Pipelines

Pipelines **connect processors together**, creating a path for frames to flow through your application. They handle the orchestration automatically.

## Voice AI Processing Flow

Now let's see how these concepts work together in a typical voice AI interaction:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Audio Input">
    User speaks → Transport receives streaming audio → Creates audio frames
  </Step>
  <Step title="Speech Recognition">
    STT processor receives audio frames → Transcribes speech in real-time →
    Outputs text frames
  </Step>
  <Step title="Context Management">
    Context processor aggregates text frames with conversation history → Creates
    formatted input for LLM
  </Step>
  <Step title="Language Processing">
    LLM processor receives context → Generates streaming response → Outputs text
    frames
  </Step>
  <Step title="Speech Synthesis">
    TTS processor receives text frames → Converts to speech → Outputs audio
    frames
  </Step>
  <Step title="Audio Output">
    Transport receives audio frames → Streams to user's device → User hears
    response
  </Step>
</Steps>

The key insight: **everything happens in parallel**. While the LLM is generating later parts of a response, earlier parts are already being converted to speech and played back to the user.

## Pipeline Architecture

Here's how this flow translates into a Pipecat pipeline:

    src="/images/pipeline-overview.png"
    alt="Pipecat Pipeline Architecture"
    style={{
      maxHeight: "750px",
    }}
  />
</Frame>

Each processor in the pipeline:

1. Receives specific frame types as input
2. Performs its specialized task (transcription, language processing, etc.)
3. Outputs new frames for the next processor
4. Passes through frames it doesn't handle

<Info>
  While frames can flow upstream or downstream, most data flows downstream as
  shown above. We'll discuss pushing frames in later sections.

## What's Next

In the following sections, we'll explore each component of this pipeline in detail:

- How to initialize sessions and connect users
- Configuring different transport options (Daily, WebRTC, Twilio, etc.)
- Setting up speech recognition and synthesis services
- Managing conversation context and LLM integration
- Handling the complete pipeline lifecycle
- Building custom processors for your specific needs

Each section includes practical examples and configuration options to help you build production-ready voice AI applications.
